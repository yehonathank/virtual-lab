ExperimentPeptideSynthesis[OligomerModels]⟹Protocol
uses a oligomer OligomerModels to create a Peptide Synthesis Protocol and associated synthesis cycles methods.


Peptide synthesis is the production of peptides, where multiple amino acids are linked via amide bonds. Peptides are chemically synthesized by the condensation reaction of the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another. This can be achieved with classical solution phase synthesis or solid phase synthesis, which is used in this experiment. In solid phase synthesis, amino acids are covalently bound to a solid support material and synthesised step-by-step in a single reaction vessel utilising selective protecting group chemistry. Peptides are attached to the solid support from their C terminus. Peptide synthesis occurs by coupling the carboxyl group of the incoming amino acid to the N-terminus of the growing peptide chain. This C-to-N synthesis is opposite from protein biosynthesis, during which the N-terminus of the incoming amino acid is linked to the C-terminus of the protein chain (N-to-C). The benefit of the solid support is the isolation of synthesis sites, making interference between growing chains impossible. The use of protecting groups is essential to avoid undesirable side reactions during this process. The most common protecting groups for amino groups used in peptide synthesis are 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc), which is used in this experiment, and t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc). Peptide synthesis allows the production of specific sequences facilitating the study protein function and the development of antibiotic drugs, antibodies and peptide biomaterials. ExperimentTotalProteinQuantification, ExperimentMassSpectrometry and ExperimentHPLC with fraction analysis can be run on the results of this experiment to measure the yield, verify the molecular weight and measure percent purity of the product.

Example Calls
Resin
The resin that will be used for the synthesis can be controlled via the Resin option. If you would like to use a resin that is pre-downloaded with a monomer, indicate that via the option DownloadResin->False and specify which Resin to use. For example, here we perform one synthesis with a regular resin (where the first monomer will be downloaded onto the resin), and another synthesis with a resin that already contains the first monomer:
ExperimentPeptideSynthesis[{myStrandModel1, myStrandModel2},
 	DownloadResin -> {True, False},
 	Resin -> {
   		Automatic,
   		Model[Sample, Resin, Oligomer, "My Pre-downloaded Resin"]
 	}
]
Cleavage and Sample Storage
By default, the synthesized strands are cleaved from the resin at the end of the synthesis and then resuspended in distilled water. If desired, it is possible to keep the strands on the resin by specifying Cleavage -> False, in which case the uncleaved strands will be stored as a resin slurry in storage buffer. The parameters for these manipulations (such as the buffer and buffer amount) are controlled via the set of Resuspension and Storage options, respectively. In the following example, the first synthesized peptide is being cleaved in 2.5 mL of cleavage solution and then resuspended in 1 mL of resuspension solution, while the second strand is kept uncleaved and is stored as a slurry in 2 mL of storage solution:
textExperimentPeptideSynthesis[{myStrandModel1, myStrandModel2},
 	Cleavage -> {True, False},
 	CleavageSolution -> mySpecialSolution,
 	CleavageVolume -> {2.5 * Milliliter, Automatic},
 	CleavageTime -> {90 * Minute, Automatic},
 	NumberOfCleavageCycles -> {1, Automatic},
 	ResuspensionBuffer -> myOtherSpecialSolution,
 	ResuspensionVolume -> {1 * Milliliter, Automatic},
 	StorageBuffer -> myStorageSolution,
 	StorageVolume -> {Automatic, 2 * Milliliter}
 ]
ExperimentPeptideSynthesis offers flexibility in the way that the cleaved and dried peptide pellet is resuspended in the final resuspension solution. The type of mixing can be specified by ResuspensionMixType as either Pipette, Sonicate or Vortex. NumberOfResuspensionMixes and ResuspensionMixTime provide control over the duration of the mixing. If more thorough mixing is desired, sequential mixing steps can be provided by a list of instruction primitives for each strand. In the following example, the peptide pellet is first resuspended by pipetting up and down 10 times, followed by a 5 minutes sonication and vortexing step to ensure full solubilization of the peptides
textExperimentPeptideSynthesis[myDifficultStrandModel1,
 	ResuspensionMixPrimitives -> {
   		Mix[MixType -> Pipette, NumberOfMixes -> 10],
   		Mix[MixType -> Vortex, Time -> (5 * Minute)],
   		Mix[MixType -> Sonicate, Time -> (5 * Minute)]
   	}

Possible Issues
No yield
For a difficult strands the chemical steps, including resin swelling, resin downloading, coupling, cleavage and resuspension, used to synthesize a strand can be controlled with the Primatives and ResuspensionMixPrimitives options.
Too many side products
Side products can be reduced by increasing the number washes between steps.
