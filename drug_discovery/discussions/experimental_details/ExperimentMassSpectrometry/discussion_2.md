ExperimentMassSpectrometry[Samples]⟹Protocol

generates a Protocol object which can be used to determine the molecular weight of compounds by ionizing them and measuring their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).



Mass Spectrometry (MS) is an analytical tool that measures the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of molecules present in a sample. The resulting data is typically presented as a mass spectrum, which is a plot of signal intensity as a function of m/z. These spectra can be used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, identify unknown compounds within a sample, quantify known materials, and to elucidate structures of molecules. Specific applications of MS include protein identification, drug testing and discovery, food contamination detection, pesticide residue analysis, among others. Often, mass spectrometry is coupled to liquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC) to provide additional separation and specificity, enabling the analysis of more complex samples (see also ExperimentLCMS and ExperimentGCMS). The key steps in mass spectrometry are the ionization of the analytes in the sample to create gas phase ions, followed by mass analysis or mass filtering of the ions, and finally mass detection. Two commonly used ionization techniques are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization (MALDI). They are so-called 'soft' ionization methods that transfer charges to molecules with a low probability that the molecules fragment into smaller particles. With different mass analyzers, more structural details can be revealed by Tandem MS (or MS/MS). In Tandem MS, ionized samples are scanned/selected by the first mass analyzer (Quadrupole detector, MS1), before being split into smaller fragment ions in a collision cell. These fragment ions are then scanned/selected again by the second mass analyzer (Time-of-Flight or Quadrupole detector, MS2). This technique helps the sequencing of biopolymers (peptides, oligosaccharides, and oligonucleotides) by analyzing their fragments. Quantitative proteomics by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is also enabled by Tandem MS.



Experimental Principles

Figure 1.1: Procedural overview of a MassSpectrometry experiment. Step 1: Samples are prepared and transferred into instrument-compatible containers. Step 2: Gas phase ions are generated from (top) liquid samples by a nebulizer at high voltage source or (bottom) from solid samples by laser ablation. Step 3: Ions are guided through the mass analyzer, where they are separated according to their m/z ratio, and the mass spectrum is recorded by the detector. Step 4: The resulting patterns is analyzed. Please refer to Figure 2.1.1 through Figure 2.3.1 for the ionization and injection types that are supported by ECL, including relevant experiment options.



Instrumentation

Microflex LRF

Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "id:M8n3rxnZLqEO"]

Figure 2.1.1: Principles of a MALDI mass spectrometer. Samples or Calibrant are deposited on the MALDIPlate together with large excess of laser-adsorbing Matrix material. Sample spots are irradiated with repeated pulsed laser shots at LaserPowerRange. Laser shots repeatedly fired (ShotsPerRaster)at a specific position until a total NumberOfShots within one sample spot is reached. The laser shots trigger ablation and desorption of both sample and matrix material. Ions are generated by being protonated or deprotonated with the nearby matrix molecules. After DelayTime, AccelerationVoltage is applied to the MALDIPlate GridVoltage at a % of that to the secondary plate. This creates a potential gradient in the ionization region, a technique also called pulsed laser extraction or delayed extraction. This technique allows synchronization of ions of different kinetic energy, hus increasing resolution. Accelerated ions then travel through a set of focusing lenses at LensVoltage into the time-of-flight mass analyzer where they are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio. Ion counts within MassRange are recorded by the detector.

Xevo G2-XS QTOF

Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "id:aXRlGn6KaWdO"]

Figure 2.2.1: Principles of an electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (QTOF). Analytes are flowed through a capillary tube into a heated source box (SourceTemeprature) at the desired InfusionFlowRate. A confluence of the source box temperature, DesolvationTemperature, DesolvationGasFlow, and ESICapillaryVolage result in neubilization, vaporization, and ionization of the analyte stream to generate an electrospray. The electrospray enters the mass spectrometer through the source cone, which serves to focus the ions and excludes contimation via a ConeGasFlow. Within the mass spectrometer, the electrospray is futher refined via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage) to yeild isolated gas-phase ions. Ions are then focused through a stepwave ion guide path via another applied voltage (StepwaveVoltage) into an ion beam. The ions travel through a quadrupole and a collision cell. Lastly, they enter a time-of-flight analyzer which resolves the ions by their mass to charge ratio according to their travel time. Spectra are continuously acquired for ions inside MassDetection hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration. For time independent samples, an average mass spectrum is generated. When coupled with liquid chromatography (see ExperimentLCMS) time-dependent mass spectra are generated instead.

QTRAP 6500

Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "id:N80DNj1aROOD"]

Figure 2.3.1: Principles of an electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-QQQ). Analytes are injected through the capillary tube into the source block at the desired InfusionFlowRate. Once the sample enters the source block, it is evaporated at the DesolvationTemperature under a stream of nitrogen gas with a pressure of DesolvationGasFlow. ESICapillaryVoltage is then applied to the capillary tubing tip to produce an electrospray, which turns into single gas-phase ions due to additional evaporation and desolvation SourceTemperature. Ions, focused by the ConeGasFlow, enter the mass spectrometer through the source cone and follow the ion path via an applied voltage (DeclusteringVoltage). They are then guided through an ion guide path via another applied voltage (IonGuideVoltange) to generate a focused ion beam. Ions travel through the first quadrupole mass analyzer (MS1), where their mass is resolved by their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z, MassDetection). After the MS1, ions enter the collision cell, where they can be fragmented by collision-induced dissociation, resulting in bond breakage and the fragmentation of the molecular ions into smaller fragments. CollisionCellExitVoltage accelerates and guides the fragmented ions to enter the second quadrupole mass analyzer (MS2), where their mass can be resolved again by their m/z (FragmentMassDetection). Spectra are continuously acquired for ions either inside MassDetection as a ranged value or as a fixed value, hitting the detector during ScanTime until the end of RunDuration, and a total mass spectrum is generated.



Experiment Options

General

IonSource

The type of ionization used to create gas phase ions from the molecules in the sample. Electrospray ionization (ESI) produces ions using an electrospray in which a high voltage is applied to a liquid to create an aerosol, and gas phase ions are formed from the fine spray of charged droplets as a result of solvent evaporation and Coulomb fission. In matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), the sample is embedded in a laser energy absorbing matrix which is then irradiated with a pulsed laser, ablating and desorbing the molecules with minimal fragmentation and creating gas phase ions from the analyte molecules in the sample.

Figure 3.1: The two most commonly used ionization techniques are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization (MALDI). They are both so-called 'soft' ionization methods that transfer charges to the molecules in the sample without causing their fragmentation (thus no destruction). In a MassSpectrometry experiment, use the IonSource option to indicate which ionization to use (MALDI|ESI). (TOP) In MALDI measurements, samples and calibrants are spotted onto the MALDI plate and embedded in a laser energy absorbing matrix. During the MALDI experiment, the sample is irradiated with a pulsed laser, ablating and desorbing the molecules with minimal fragmentation and creating gas phase ions from the analyte molecules in the sample. Most ions generated during MALDI measurements have a single charge, thus interpretation of acquired spectra is facilitated. MALDI is mostly used for characterization of large, thermally labile compounds, and is able to handle higher concentration of salt when compared to ESI, which is a great advantage when analyzing biological samples in situ. (BOTTOM) ESI produces ions using an electrospray in which a high voltage is applied to a liquid passing through a capillary tube to create an aerosol, and gas phase ions are formed from the fine spray of charged droplets as a result of solvent evaporation and Coulomb fission. ESI produces mostly multiply protonated ions and has broad utility for the analysis of very small and large compounds, and intact bio-molecules and protein structure.

Default Value: Automatic

Default Calculation: Is automatically set to ESI or MALDI, respectively, whenever ESI or MALDI specific options or IonSource are specified. If none specified, defaults to MALDI if sample contains DNA oligomers and other synthetic nucleic acid oligomers, and ESI for all other samples.

Pattern Description: ESI or MALDI.

Programmatic Pattern: IonSourceP | Automatic

Instrument

The instrument used to perform the mass spectrometry analysis by ionization of sample and analysis by sequential mass analyzers.

Default Value: Automatic

Default Calculation: Is automatically set to the MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) (Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "Microflex LT"]) whenever the IonSource option is set to MALDI and/or MALDI specific options are specified. Otherwise, defaults to ESI-QTOF (Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer, "Xevo G2-XS QTOF"]).

Pattern Description: An object of type or subtype Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer] or Object[Instrument, MassSpectrometer]

Programmatic Pattern: ObjectP[{Model[Instrument, MassSpectrometer], Object[Instrument, MassSpectrometer]}] | Automatic

MassAnalyzer

The manner of detection used to resolve and detect molecules. For now, we have 3 mass analyzers available for ExperimentMassSpectrometry. Time-Of-Flight (TOF) analyzer separates the ions by their flight time. QTOF accelerates ions through an elongated flight tube, followed by traveling down the quandrupole analyzer where only ions with selected mass to charge ratio will pass (either a mass range or specific mass value), and then passing a TOF analyzer. QQQ accelerates the ions and selects through two quadrupole analyzers. Both QTOF and QQQ have a collision cell, which optionally fragments the ions, in between the first and the second mass analyzer.

Default Value: Automatic

Default Calculation: For MALDI as the ion source, MassAnalyzer is automatically set to TOF detector, as TOF is the only detector that connects to MALDI for now. For ESI ion source, the detector can be TOF/QTOF for the ESI-QTOF study and quadrupole(Q)/triple-quadrupole (QQQ) for ESI-QQQ study. For APCI as the ion source, the analyzer can be quadrupole or triple-quadrupole.

Pattern Description: TOF, QTOF, or TripleQuadrupole.

Programmatic Pattern: (TOF | QTOF | TripleQuadrupole) | Automatic

InjectionType

The type of sample submission method to employ for ESI-QTOF and ESI-QQQ. In DirectInfusion, the sample is directly injected into the instrument, using either a built-in fluidics pump system (ESI-QTOF) or a syringe pump (ESI-QQQ), of the mass spectrometer without the use of any mobile phase. Due to the manual nature of the injection, this is well suited for measuring a small number of samples. Furthermore, this is recommended when high sample volumes of are available (>500 Microliter), the sample does not require cooling, and a quick result is desired. It produces a constant signal over time. FlowInjection works by injecting the sample into a flowing solvent stream using a liquid chromatography autosampler and pumps, in the absence of chromatographic separation. FlowInjection can accomodate up to 2*96 samples and is thus suited for highthrougput analyses. It produces a brief peak of signal at the time that the analyte reaches the detector.

Figure 3.2: Overview of ESI injection types. In ESI experiments, the sample can be infused into the mass spectrometer directly (DirectInfusion) or injected via an affiliated LC system (FlowInjection). In both cases, the spectra acquired over RunDuration are averaged to produce a single MassSpectrum. Use the option InjectionType to indicate which type of injection should be used in an ESI experiment at ECL (DirectInfusion|FlowInjection). (TOP) For FlowInjection, the samples (either in 2mL tubes or 96 deep well plates) are loaded into the temperature-controlled (via SampleTemperature) autosampler module of a liquid chromatography (LC) system coupled to the mass spectrometer. A small amount of sample, InjectionVolume, is then picked up and injected at a constant rate, InjectionFlowRate, into a flowing solvent stream of mobile phase (Buffer) using the HPLC pumps, similar to ExperimentHPLC / ExperimentLCMS but in the absence of chromatographic separation (no column). FlowInjection can accomodate up to 2*96 samples and is thus suited for highthrougput analyses. It produces a brief peak of signal at the time that the analyte reaches the detector. (BOTTOM) DirectInfusion is compatible with 2mL containers and 30mL reservoirs. The sample is attached to the fluidics deck of the mass spectrometer. A small amount of sample, InjectionVolume, is directly injected into the instrument at a constant rate (InjectionFlowRate) using the built-in pump system, without the use of any mobile phase. Due to the manual nature of the injection, this is well suited for measuring a small number of samples. Furthermore, this is recommended when high sample volumes of are available (>500 Microliter), the sample does not require cooling, and a quick result is desired (since no HPLC instrument and mobile phase setup is required). It produces a constant signal over time.

Default Calculation: Is automatically set to Null for MALDI mass spectrometry. If ESI mass spectrometry, is automatically set to FlowInjection if the number of samples is larger than 5, and/or the samples are inside a 96 deep well plate, and/or none of the flow injection options are set, otherwise is set to DirectInfusion.

ESI Ionization

ESICapillaryVoltage

This option (also known as Ion Spray Voltage) indicates the absolute voltage applied to the tip of the stainless steel capillary tubing in order to produce charged droplets. Adjust this voltage to maximize sensitivity. For ESI-QTOF, most compounds are optimized between 0.5 and 3.2 kV in ESI positive ion mode and 0.5 and 2.6 kV in ESI negative ion mode. For ESI-QQQ this parameter is 5.5 kV for positive ion mode and -4.5 kV for negative ion mode, for standard flow UPLC a value of 0.5 kV is typically best for maximum sensitivity. Thie parameter can be altered according to sample type. For low flow applications, best sensitivity will be achieved with a relatively high value in ESI positive (e.g. 3.0 kV for ESI-QTOF and 5.5 or -4.5 kV for ESI-QQQ positive and negative, respectively).

Default Value: Automatic

Default Calculation: For ESI-QTOF: Is automatically set according to the flow rate: For ESI-QTOF: 0-0.02 ml/min -> 3.0 kV (Positive) or 2.8 kV (Negative), 0.021-0.1 ml/min -> 2.5 kV, 0.101 - 0.3 ml/min -> 2.0 kV, 0.301 - 0.5 ml/min -> 1.5 kV, > 0.5 ml/min -> 1.0 kv .

DeclusteringVoltage

For ESI-QTOF, indicates the voltage between the ion block (the reduced-pressure chamber of the source block) and the stepwave ion guide (the optics before the quadrupole mass analyzer). This voltage attracts charged ions from the capillary tip into the ion block leading into the mass spectrometer. For ESI-QTOF, this voltage is typically set to 25-100 V and its tuning has little effect on sensitivity. For ESI-QQQ, this controls the voltage applied between the orifice (where ions enter the mass spectrometer) and the ion guide to prevent the ionized small particles from aggregating together. It's normally optimized between -300 to 300 V, and its sensitivity depends on chemical composition and charge state.

Default Value: Automatic

For multiply charged species it is typically set to to 40-50 V, and higher for singly charged species. In general higher cone voltages (120-150 V) are needed for larger mass ions such as intact proteins and monoclonal antibodies. It also has greatest effect on in-source fragmentation and should be decreased if in-source fragmentation is observed but not desired.

Default Value: Automatic

Example Calls

MALDI Mass Spectrometry

Use MALDI mass spectrometry to acquire mass spectra. Provide the calibrant and the matrix to use, and indicate that during spotting of the MALDIPlate every other well is skipped in order to decrease any cross-contamination risks between samples:

ExperimentMassSpectrometry[mySamples,

 	IonSource -> MALDI,

 	Calibrant -> Model[

   		Sample, StockSolution, Standard,

   "IDT ssDNA Ladder 10-60 nt, 40 ng/uL"

   	],

 	Matrix -> Model[Sample, Matrix, "THAP MALDI matrix"],

 	SpottingPattern -> Spaced

 ]

Use MALDI mass spectrometry to acquire mass spectra. Provide optimized ionization parameters for your samples of particular analyte type and mass scan range:

ExperimentMassSpectrometry[mySamples,

 	IonSource -> MALDI,

 	MassDetection -> Span[6000 * Gram / Mole, 19000 * Gram / Mole],

 	LaserPowerRange -> Span[55 * Percent, 75 * Percent],

 	DelayTime -> (250 * Nanosecond),

 	AccelerationVoltage -> (19.5 * Kilovolt),

 	GridVoltage -> (16 * Kilovolt),

 	LensVoltage -> (7 * Kilovolt)

 ]

ESI Mass Spectrometry (both TripleQuadrupole and QTOF detectors)

Use ESI and DirectInfusion mass spectrometry to acquire mass spectra. The sample is connected directly to the fluidics deck of the mass spectrometer. First, the QTOF instrument's mass calibration is performed to ensure optimal mass accuracy. Then, for the duration of RunDuration, the sample will be infused directly from the fluidics deck into the mass spectrometer leading to a constant signal over time:

ExperimentMassSpectrometry[mySamples,

 	IonSource -> ESI,

 	InjectionType -> DirectInfusion,

 	InfusionFlowRate -> (25 * Microliter / Minute),

 	RunDuration -> (0.8 * Minute)

 ]

Use ESI and flow injection mass spectrometry to acquire mass spectra. The sample is placed into the autosampler of the affiliated LC system. After mass calibration of the QTOF, the selected InjectionVolume is picked up from the sample by the autosampler needle, sandwiched in the chosen Buffer and injected into the mass spectrometer at InfusionFlowRate. The resulting mass spectrum will have a peak of signal when the sample reaches the detector (at around 20-30 Seconds given the flow rate provided here):

ExperimentMassSpectrometry[mySamples,

 	IonSource -> ESI,

 	InjectionType -> FlowInjection,

 	InjectionVolume -> (20 * Microliter),

 	InfusionFlowRate -> (120 * Microliter / Minute),

 	Buffer -> Model[

   		Sample, StockSolution,

   "0.1% FA with 5% Acetonitrile in Water, LCMS-grade"

   	]

 ]

Optimize the signal intensity of your sample. Increasing the ScanTime (or DwellTime) allows more ions to reach the detector for each particular spectral acquisition thus increasing signal intensity. Ionization parameters must always be adjusted according to the sample properties in order to achieve optimal sensitivity:

ExperimentMassSpectrometry[myDifficultSample,

 	IonSource -> ESI,

 	InjectionType -> FlowInjection,

 	InfusionFlowRate -> (25 * Microliter / Minute),

 	ScanTime -> (2 * Second),

 	ESICapillaryVoltage -> (3.2 * Kilovolt),

 	SourceTemperature -> (120 * Celsius),

 	DesolvationGasFlow -> (700 * Liter / Hour)

 ]

Tandem Mass-Spectrometry

Toggle the dissociation of ions and control the intensity of the collision. Select fragment ions to detection:

ExperimentMassSpectrometry[mySamples,

 	MassAnalyzer -> TripleQuadrupole,

 	Fragment -> True,

 	CollisionEnergy -> (50 * Volt),

 	FragmentMassDetection -> Span[100 * Gram / Mole, 300 * Gram / Mole]

 ]

Change the ScanMode (the alternation of selection for both fragment and intact ions). For the case of MultipleReactionMonitoring, specific intact and fragment ions can be specified for measurement:

ExperimentMassSpectrometry[mySamples,

 	MassAnalyzer -> TripleQuadrupole,

 	ScanMode -> MultipleReactionMonitoring,

 	MultipleReactionMonitoringAssays -> {

    			Quantity[356, "Grams" / "Moles"],

    			Quantity[30, "Volts"],

    			Quantity[234, "Grams" / "Moles"],

    			Quantity[4, "Seconds"]

    		},

   		{

    			Quantity[456, "Grams" / "Moles"],

    			Quantity[40, "Volts"],

    			Quantity[345, "Grams" / "Moles"],

    			Quantity[2, "Seconds"]

    		},

   		{

    			Quantity[453, "Grams" / "Moles"],

    			Quantity[65, "Volts"],

    			Quantity[345, "Grams" / "Moles"],

    			Quantity[3, "Seconds"]

    		},

   		{

    			Quantity[764, "Grams" / "Moles"],

    			Quantity[30, "Volts"],

    			Quantity[345, "Grams" / "Moles"],

    			Quantity[2, "Seconds"]

    		}

   	}

 ]

Change the ScanMode (the alternation of selection for both fragment and intact ions). For the case of NeutralIonLoss, the NeutralLoss field can be used to track the loss e loss of small molecules (such as water, ammonia, or carbon monoxide) during intact ion fragmentation.

ExperimentMassSpectrometry[mySamples,

 	MassDetection -> Span[200 * Gram / Mole, 600 * Gram / Mole],

 	MassAnalyzer -> TripleQuadrupole,

 ScanMode -> MultipleReactionMonitoring,

 NeutralLoss -> (28 * Gram / Mole)

 ]



Preferred Input Containers

ESI-QTOF Direct Infusion: the fluidics deck of the QTOF supports 2mL tubes (1mL - 1.5mL volume) and 30mL reservoirs (2mL to 30mL volume). The sample amount needed is the sum of dead volume (1mL and 2mL respectively) and RunDuration * InfusionFlowRate.

ESI-QQQ Direct Infusion: any container that the solution inside can be drawn by a syringe. The sample amount needed is InfusionVolume. For a very large-volume sample, transferring to a small-volume tube (e.g., 2mL skirted tube) is recommended.

ESI Flow Injection (for Both ESI-QQQ and ESI QTOF): for flow injection, samples are loaded into the LC autosampler which supports 2mL HPLC vials and regular 96 deep well plates. The sample amount used is the sum of dead volume (20 ul) and RunDuration * InfusionFlowRate.

MALDI-TOF: Any container that fit on the robotic liquid handler decks, where the spotting of the target plate takes place, is supported. For small-volume samples, the use of skirted tubes or plates with V-shaped bottom is recommended (see a non-complete list of examples below).

Possible Issues

Choice of MALDI matrix

In MALDI experiments, the choice of right matrix is key to successful ionization. In general, highly polar analytes are preferably combined with highly polar matrices, and non-polar analytes work better with non-polar matrices.

Signal optimization in MALDI experiments

In MALDI mass spectrometry experiments, different matrices and sample types (in particular different mass scan ranges) require different laser and voltage settings to achieve optimal signal intensity, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. You may use the following rough optimization strategy: If the signal-to-noise ratio is low, adjust the acceleration voltage and the number of shots. If the signal intensity is low, increase the laser power. Note that excessive laser power may result in saturated peaks with poor resolution and high sample consumption. If the mass resolution is low (peaks are wide), adjust the delay time and the grid voltage. In general, analytes with higher m/z require longer delay times and lower grid voltages, while analytes with smaller m/z need shorter delay time and higher grid voltage for optimal performance.

Signal optimization in ESI experiments

In ESI mass spectrometry, different sample types and flow rates require different source settings. You may follow these guidelines for signal optimization: If the signal intensity is too high, lower the capillary voltage and the injection flow rate, or dilute the samples. If the sensitivity is too low, adjust the capillary and sample cone voltage and temperature, or increase injected sample amount. Note that sometimes matrix effects can occur, so in rare cases, a dilution of the sample can paradoxically lead to an increase in sensitivity. If the signal-to-noise ratio is low, lower the scan rate and increase the injection flow rate, and inspect your buffer for contaminants that may cause an increased baseline.

To further refine the **ExperimentMassSpectrometry** protocol setup and ensure alignment with the agenda's goals, I will incorporate more detailed justifications, integration with machine learning, timeline considerations, and potential risks. Here is the revised experiment setup:

```plaintext
ExperimentMassSpectrometry[
    myPeptideSamples,
    IonSource -> ESI,
    InjectionType -> FlowInjection,
    InjectionVolume -> (20 * Microliter),
    InfusionFlowRate -> (120 * Microliter / Minute),
    Buffer -> Model[Sample, StockSolution, "0.1% FA with 5% Acetonitrile in Water, LCMS-grade"],
    MassDetection -> Span[50 * Gram / Mole, 2000 * Gram / Mole]
]
```

### Revised Explanation and Justification:

1. **IonSource**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (ESI for non-DNA samples)
   - **Chosen Value**: ESI
   - **Justification**: ESI is selected for its ability to ionize peptides effectively, producing multiply charged ions that enhance mass spectrometry resolution and sensitivity. This choice supports the detection of a wide range of peptide masses, crucial for validating machine learning predictions on peptide modifications and interactions.

2. **InjectionType**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (FlowInjection for >5 samples)
   - **Chosen Value**: FlowInjection
   - **Justification**: FlowInjection allows for high-throughput analysis, essential given the 3-month experimental timeline. This method ensures efficient processing of multiple samples, aligning with the project's need for rapid validation of machine learning-generated peptide candidates.

3. **InjectionVolume**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (10 Microliter for FlowInjection)
   - **Chosen Value**: 20 Microliter
   - **Justification**: Increasing the injection volume enhances signal intensity, which is critical for detecting low-abundance peptides or those with subtle modifications predicted by machine learning models. This adjustment ensures robust data collection for model validation.

4. **InfusionFlowRate**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (100 Microliter/Minute for FlowInjection)
   - **Chosen Value**: 120 Microliter/Minute
   - **Justification**: A higher flow rate optimizes the balance between sensitivity and analysis time, crucial for maintaining throughput without compromising data quality. This setting supports the project's timeline by enabling faster sample processing.

5. **Buffer**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (0.1% FA with 5% Acetonitrile in Water, LCMS-grade)
   - **Chosen Value**: Model[Sample, StockSolution, "0.1% FA with 5% Acetonitrile in Water, LCMS-grade"]
   - **Justification**: This buffer provides a stable ionization environment, minimizing matrix effects and enhancing peptide ionization efficiency. It ensures consistent data quality, which is vital for comparing experimental results with machine learning predictions.

6. **MassDetection**
   - **Default Value**: Automatic (50-1200 m/z for small molecules)
   - **Chosen Value**: Span[50 * Gram / Mole, 2000 * Gram / Mole]
   - **Justification**: The expanded mass detection range accommodates the expected mass range of peptides, including those with post-translational modifications or chemical modifications predicted by machine learning. This ensures comprehensive detection and validation of all relevant ions.

### Integration with Machine Learning:
- Mass spectrometry data will be used to validate and refine machine learning models by providing empirical evidence of peptide modifications and interactions. Specifically, the data will inform metrics such as binding affinity predictions and structural stability, allowing for iterative model improvements. For example, if a peptide shows a binding affinity improvement of more than 20% compared to initial predictions, the model will be updated to incorporate these findings.

### Timeline Considerations:
- The chosen parameters facilitate high-throughput analysis, ensuring that the experimental validation fits within the 3-month timeline. Key milestones include completing data collection within the first month, conducting preliminary data analysis by the second month, and refining machine learning models by the end of the third month. Potential bottlenecks, such as instrument availability, will be addressed through pre-scheduling and contingency planning.

### Potential Risks and Mitigation:
- **Risk**: Sample degradation or instrument limitations could impact data quality.
- **Mitigation**: Implement rigorous sample handling protocols, such as maintaining samples at optimal temperatures and minimizing exposure to degrading conditions. Regular instrument maintenance and calibration will be scheduled to ensure consistent performance. Contingency plans include alternative analysis methods if issues arise.

### Clinical Value and Impact:
- Successful validation of peptide modifications could lead to new therapeutic candidates or insights into disease mechanisms. The project aims to contribute to clinical outcomes by identifying peptides with high specificity and efficacy, potentially addressing unmet medical needs in targeted disease areas. For instance, validated peptides could be used in therapeutic applications for diseases like cancer or diabetes, where specific protein interactions are critical.

By addressing these points, the experiment setup is now more closely aligned with the agenda's goals, ensuring that the experimental design supports both the scientific and clinical objectives of the project.
