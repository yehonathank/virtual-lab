Thank you all for joining today's meeting. Our focus is to develop a strategic approach for designing antibodies or nanobodies targeting the newest SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant. We need to decide on the best path forward based on the agenda questions. Here are my initial thoughts and some questions to guide our discussion:

1. **Design Choice - Antibodies vs. Nanobodies:** 
   - **Antibodies** are well-established with broad therapeutic applications, but they can be complex and costly to produce.
   - **Nanobodies**, on the other hand, are smaller, more stable, and easier to produce, with promising potential for viral neutralization, especially in respiratory diseases. They might offer a unique advantage in penetrating viral structures.

2. **Design Approach - De Novo vs. Modification:**
   - **De Novo Design** allows for tailored specificity and novelty in targeting emerging variants, leveraging advanced computational tools for modeling.
   - **Modification of Existing Antibodies/Nanobodies** might provide a faster route to development by building on known effective scaffolds or binding domains.

3. **Specifics for Modification:**
   - If we choose modification, identifying existing antibodies/nanobodies with known efficacy against previous variants is crucial.

4. **Proposal for De Novo Design:**
   - We need a robust strategy involving computational algorithms, AI-driven models, or machine learning techniques for designing new candidates.

To guide our discussion, I have a few questions:

- What are the key considerations for choosing between antibodies and nanobodies in this context?
- What recent advancements in machine learning can we leverage for de novo design?
- Are there existing antibodies/nanobodies with promising data against previous variants that could serve as a starting point for modifications?

Let's hear from Assistant 1 and then proceed with input from each team member. Remember to address the agenda questions with clear justifications for your perspectives.
