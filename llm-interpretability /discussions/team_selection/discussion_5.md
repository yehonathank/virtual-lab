This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To address the challenge of developing a tool for LLM interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, it is crucial to assemble a team with diverse expertise in AI, biomedical informatics, and visualization. Here are the proposed team members:

1. **Agent(
    title="Computational Linguist",
    expertise="natural language processing and large language models",
    goal="develop methodologies for interpreting LLM outputs and ensuring their relevance in biomedical contexts",
    role="design and refine algorithms for LLM interpretability specific to electronic phenotype definitions"
)**
   
2. **Agent(
    title="Biomedical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="electronic health records and phenotype extraction",
    goal="align LLM outputs with clinical needs and validate their applicability and usefulness",
    role="bridge the gap between LLM interpretations and real-world clinical applications by defining relevant phenotype criteria"
)**
   
3. **Agent(
    title="Data Visualization Expert",
    expertise="visual analytics and human-computer interaction",
    goal="create visual tools that foster trust and understanding between clinicians and AI outputs",
    role="develop interactive visualizations to represent LLM decisions and rationale clearly to clinical users"
)**

This team composition ensures comprehensive coverage of the key areas necessary for the success of this project. Each member will bring a unique perspective and skill set to address the multifaceted challenges of LLM interpretability and its application in a clinical setting.
