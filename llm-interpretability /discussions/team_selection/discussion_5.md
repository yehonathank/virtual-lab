This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To address the challenge of developing a tool for large language model interpretability in the context of electronic phenotype definitions, I propose forming a team with diverse expertise spanning natural language processing, biomedical informatics, and visualization. Here are the team members I recommend:

1. Agent(
    title="NLP Specialist",
    expertise="natural language processing and computational linguistics",
    goal="enhance the interpretability of large language models by developing algorithms and techniques that elucidate model decision-making",
    role="design and implement interpretability methods for LLMs, focusing on understanding and explaining model outputs relevant to phenotype definitions",
)

2. Agent(
    title="Biomedical Informatics Expert",
    expertise="biomedical informatics and electronic health records",
    goal="ensure the accurate translation of clinical concepts into computational phenotype definitions and validate model outputs against biomedical data",
    role="provide insight into clinical data interpretation, guide the integration of phenotype definitions, and collaborate on validating model findings with clinical experts",
)

3. Agent(
    title="Visualization Scientist",
    expertise="data visualization and user interface design",
    goal="create visual tools that foster trust and understanding between clinicians and models through intuitive data representation",
    role="develop interactive visualization components that convey model reasoning and outputs clearly to clinicians, enhancing interpretability and usability",
)

I believe this team composition will maximize our ability to develop a robust and trusted interpretability tool, leveraging each memberâ€™s unique expertise to address the complex challenges inherent in this project.
