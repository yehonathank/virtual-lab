This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here are summaries of the previous meetings:

[begin summary 1]

To effectively develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability, particularly for creating electronic phenotype definitions, it is essential to assemble a team with diverse expertise. We aim to incorporate both computational techniques and a visual perspective to build trust between clinicians and the model. With this in mind, here are the proposed team members for the discussion:

```python
Agent(
    title="Computational Linguist",
    expertise="natural language processing and language model interpretability",
    goal="develop methods to increase transparency in LLM outputs, focusing on phenotype definitions",
    role="design and implement algorithms for extracting and visualizing linguistic patterns from LLMs",
)

Agent(
    title="Biomedical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="electronic health records (EHR) and phenotype algorithm development",
    goal="ensure the tool is aligned with clinical data standards and effectively integrates phenotype definitions",
    role="provide domain expertise for creating clinically relevant and accurate phenotype models",
)

Agent(
    title="Data Visualization Expert",
    expertise="creating interactive visualizations for complex data sets",
    goal="develop a user-friendly interface that enhances clinician trust by visually explaining LLM outputs",
    role="design visualization tools that make LLM interpretations accessible and intuitive for clinical users",
