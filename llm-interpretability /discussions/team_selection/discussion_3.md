This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To ensure the success of our research project on developing a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of electronic phenotype definitions, I have carefully considered the skills and expertise required. Here is the proposed team of three scientists who will bring complementary skills to the project:

1. Agent(
    title="Data Scientist",
    expertise="large language models and natural language processing",
    goal="develop algorithms and methodologies for interpreting LLM outputs in electronic phenotype definitions",
    role="design and implement the core LLM interpretability algorithms, ensuring they are robust and scalable"
)

2. Agent(
    title="Clinical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="electronic health records and clinical phenotype definitions",
    goal="ensure the interpretability tool meets clinical standards and is aligned with healthcare needs",
    role="provide insights on clinical semantics and collaborate with the data scientist to integrate clinical knowledge into the tool"
)

3. Agent(
    title="Visualization Expert",
    expertise="data visualization and human-computer interaction",
    goal="create visual interfaces that enhance trust and understanding between clinicians and the LLM tool",
    role="design and implement intuitive visualizations that translate complex model outputs into easily interpretable formats for clinicians"
)

Together, this team will collaboratively address the challenges of LLM interpretability and develop a tool that not only accurately defines electronic phenotypes but also fosters trust among clinicians through visual representation.
