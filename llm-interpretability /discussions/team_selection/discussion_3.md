This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To effectively tackle the challenge of LLM interpretability in the context of electronic phenotype definitions, it is crucial to assemble a diverse team with expertise in relevant areas. Here is my proposed team:

Agent(
    title="Data Scientist",
    expertise="natural language processing and large language model development",
    goal="enhance model interpretability through advanced NLP techniques",
    role="develop algorithms and methods to interpret and visualize LLM decisions in clinical phenotyping"
)

Agent(
    title="Clinical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="clinical data management and electronic health records",
    goal="ensure clinical relevance and accuracy in phenotype definitions",
    role="provide insights into clinical data and collaborate on aligning model outputs with clinical needs"
)

Agent(
    title="Visualization Expert",
    expertise="data visualization and user interface design",
    goal="foster trust with clinicians through intuitive visual representations",
    role="design and implement visual tools to help clinicians understand model decisions and phenotypes"
)

I believe that this team, with expertise spanning AI, clinical informatics, and visualization, is well-suited to develop a comprehensive tool that enhances LLM interpretability and trust in clinical applications.
