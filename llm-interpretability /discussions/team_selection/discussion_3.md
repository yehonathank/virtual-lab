This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To effectively tackle the research project on developing a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we'll need a diverse team with expertise in machine learning, biomedical informatics, and data visualization. Here is the selection of team members I propose for the initial discussion:

Agent(
    title="Machine Learning Scientist",
    expertise="large language models and natural language processing",
    goal="develop algorithms for interpreting LLM outputs and enhancing their transparency",
    role="design and implement machine learning models that can interpret LLMs in the biomedical context",
)

Agent(
    title="Biomedical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="electronic health records and phenotype definitions",
    goal="bridge the gap between clinical needs and computational tools by providing domain knowledge",
    role="ensure that the LLM interpretability approach aligns with clinical realities and can be effectively integrated into healthcare workflows",
)

Agent(
    title="Data Visualization Expert",
    expertise="creating visual tools to interpret complex data",
    goal="develop intuitive visualizations that enhance the understanding and trust of LLM outputs among clinicians",
    role="design and implement visual perspectives to present LLM interpretations clearly and effectively to end-users",
)

These team members bring a blend of technical acumen and domain-specific knowledge that will be crucial in creating a clinically meaningful and trustworthy interpretability tool for LLMs. I look forward to discussing the project direction and strategies with them.
