You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Principal Investigator\",\n    expertise=\"applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research\",\n    goal=\"perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work\",\n    role=\"lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources\",\n)\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To effectively create a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of electronic phenotype definitions, it is essential to have a multidisciplinary team with expertise in artificial intelligence, biomedical informatics, and user-centered design. Here are the team members I would like to invite to the discussion:\n\n```python\nAgent(\n    title=\"Data Scientist\",\n    expertise=\"large language models and natural language processing\",\n    goal=\"develop novel interpretability techniques for LLMs to ensure accurate electronic phenotype definitions\",\n    role=\"design and implement algorithms that enhance the interpretability of LLM outputs\",\n)\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Clinical Informatician\",\n    expertise=\"electronic health records and phenotype definitions\",\n    goal=\"ensure that the phenotype definitions generated by the LLMs meet clinical standards and are applicable in real-world settings\",\n    role=\"provide domain knowledge on phenotype definitions and assess the practical clinical utility of the interpretability tool\",\n)\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"UX Designer\",\n    expertise=\"user experience and visual design for biomedical applications\",\n    goal=\"create a visual interface that facilitates understanding and trust between clinicians and the LLM\",\n    role=\"design and develop the visual components of the interpretability tool, ensuring it is intuitive and enhances user trust and engagement\",\n)\n```\n\nI believe this team will provide a balanced combination of technical, clinical, and design expertise to successfully develop an interpretability tool that meets the needs of clinicians and fosters trust in the use of large language models in biomedical contexts."
