## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To successfully develop a tool for LLM interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, while also incorporating a visual perspective, we need a diverse team of experts who bring complementary skills to the project. Here is my proposed list of team members:

1. **Agent(
    title="Machine Learning Scientist",
    expertise="large language models and natural language processing",
    goal="develop and refine algorithms to enhance LLM interpretability and performance",
    role="design and implement algorithms to improve model transparency, and collaborate with other team members to integrate these solutions into the interpretability tool",
)**

2. **Agent(
    title="Clinical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="electronic health records and phenotype definitions",
    goal="ensure clinical relevance and accuracy of phenotype definitions created by the LLM",
    role="bridge the gap between clinical knowledge and machine learning models, validate phenotype definitions, and provide clinical context for interpretability solutions",
)**

3. **Agent(
    title="Data Visualization Expert",
    expertise="visual analytics and user interface design",
    goal="create intuitive visualizations that foster clinician trust and enhance model interpretability",
    role="develop visualization techniques to represent LLM outputs and their decision-making processes, ensuring these are easily understandable by clinicians",
)**

This team covers the necessary expertise in machine learning, clinical relevance, and data visualization, allowing us to address both the technical and user-centric aspects of the project comprehensively. Let me know if you have any questions or need further elaboration on the team selection.
