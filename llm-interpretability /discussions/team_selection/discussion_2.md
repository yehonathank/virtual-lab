This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To effectively develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, incorporating a visual perspective, I propose assembling a diverse team with expertise in relevant areas. Here are the recommended team members:

```python
Agent(
    title="Computational Linguist",
    expertise="natural language processing, language model interpretability",
    goal="develop methods to enhance the interpretability of language models in biomedical applications",
    role="design and implement interpretability techniques for LLMs, focusing on understanding and explaining model outputs"
)

Agent(
    title="Bioinformatician",
    expertise="electronic health records, phenotype extraction",
    goal="ensure accurate extraction and definition of phenotypes from biomedical data",
    role="guide the integration of electronic health record data with LLMs, and validate phenotype definitions"
)

Agent(
    title="Data Visualization Specialist",
    expertise="data visualization, human-computer interaction",
    goal="create intuitive visualizations to foster trust and understanding between clinicians and AI models",
    role="develop visual tools to represent LLM decision-making processes and outputs in a clinician-friendly manner"
)
```

These team members will bring a balance of skills necessary to address the technical, biomedical, and usability aspects of the project, ensuring a comprehensive approach to developing the desired tool.
