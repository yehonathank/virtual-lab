You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Principal Investigator\",\n    expertise=\"applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research\",\n    goal=\"perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work\",\n    role=\"lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources\",\n)\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To effectively develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability, particularly for creating electronic phenotype definitions, it is essential to assemble a team with diverse expertise. We aim to incorporate both computational techniques and a visual perspective to build trust between clinicians and the model. With this in mind, here are the proposed team members for the discussion:\n\n```python\nAgent(\n    title=\"Computational Linguist\",\n    expertise=\"natural language processing and language model interpretability\",\n    goal=\"develop methods to increase transparency in LLM outputs, focusing on phenotype definitions\",\n    role=\"design and implement algorithms for extracting and visualizing linguistic patterns from LLMs\",\n)\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Biomedical Informatics Specialist\",\n    expertise=\"electronic health records (EHR) and phenotype algorithm development\",\n    goal=\"ensure the tool is aligned with clinical data standards and effectively integrates phenotype definitions\",\n    role=\"provide domain expertise for creating clinically relevant and accurate phenotype models\",\n)\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Data Visualization Expert\",\n    expertise=\"creating interactive visualizations for complex data sets\",\n    goal=\"develop a user-friendly interface that enhances clinician trust by visually explaining LLM outputs\",\n    role=\"design visualization tools that make LLM interpretations accessible and intuitive for clinical users\",\n)\n```\n\nThese team members bring the necessary skills and perspectives to achieve the project's objectives, ensuring comprehensive interpretability and clinician engagement in the developed tool."
