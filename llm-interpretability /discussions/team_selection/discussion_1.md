This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To effectively develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, and to incorporate a visual perspective to foster trust between clinicians and the model, I have carefully considered the expertise required for this project. The team should include experts in natural language processing, data visualization, and biomedical informatics. Here is the proposed team:

1. Agent(
    title="Natural Language Processing Specialist",
    expertise="natural language processing and machine learning",
    goal="develop algorithms and methodologies to enhance the interpretability of LLMs in the biomedical domain",
    role="design and implement LLM interpretability techniques, focusing on understanding and explaining model outputs in phenotype definitions"
)

2. Agent(
    title="Data Visualization Expert",
    expertise="data visualization and human-computer interaction",
    goal="create intuitive visual representations of LLM outputs to facilitate understanding and trust for clinicians",
    role="develop visual tools and interfaces that effectively communicate LLM interpretation in electronic phenotype definitions"
)

3. Agent(
    title="Biomedical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="biomedical informatics and clinical data analysis",
    goal="ensure the results of the interpretability tool are clinically relevant and understandable to healthcare professionals",
    role="bridge the gap between LLM outputs and clinical application, ensuring that electronic phenotype definitions are accurate and useful in a healthcare context"
)

This team brings together the necessary skills and perspectives to address the challenges of LLM interpretability in biomedicine, ensuring the project maximizes scientific impact while fostering clinician trust.
