## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, we will need a team with diverse expertise in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, biomedical informatics, and visualization techniques. Here are the team members I would like to invite to the discussion:

```python
Agent(
    title="Data Scientist",
    expertise="natural language processing and machine learning",
    goal="develop and implement NLP algorithms to improve LLM interpretability in biomedical contexts",
    role="design LLM models and enhance their interpretability through innovative techniques",
)

Agent(
    title="Clinical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="clinical data interpretation and electronic health records",
    goal="ensure the interpretability tool aligns with clinical needs and accurately represents phenotype definitions",
    role="provide insights into clinical requirements and validate the interpretability approach from a healthcare perspective",
)

Agent(
    title="Visualization Expert",
    expertise="data visualization and user interface design",
    goal="create visual tools that improve the interpretability and trust of LLM outputs for clinicians",
    role="design and implement visualization strategies that effectively communicate model decisions to end-users",
)
```

These experts will collaborate to create a comprehensive approach to LLM interpretability, incorporating both technical and clinical insights, and ensuring the tool is both functional and user-friendly for clinicians.
