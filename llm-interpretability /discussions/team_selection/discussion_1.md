This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

For this project focused on large language model (LLM) interpretability for electronic phenotype definitions, incorporating both software techniques and a visual perspective, it is crucial to assemble a team with diverse expertise in AI, biomedical informatics, and user interface design. Here's the proposed team of three scientists:

1. Agent(
    title="Machine Learning Scientist",
    expertise="natural language processing and deep learning",
    goal="develop novel algorithms for interpretability of large language models",
    role="design and implement LLM interpretability techniques and validate their performance in the context of electronic phenotype definitions",
)

2. Agent(
    title="Biomedical Informatician",
    expertise="clinical data analysis and electronic health records",
    goal="ensure that the LLM interpretability approaches are clinically relevant and effective",
    role="provide domain knowledge for electronic phenotype definitions and assist in evaluating the interpretability of LLMs with respect to clinical applications",
)

3. Agent(
    title="User Interface Designer",
    expertise="human-computer interaction and visualization",
    goal="create intuitive and trustworthy visualizations of LLM outputs for clinicians",
    role="design and test user interfaces that enhance clinician trust and understanding of LLM-generated electronic phenotype definitions through visual aids",
)

These team members will bring a well-rounded set of skills to address both the technical and user-focused aspects of the project.
