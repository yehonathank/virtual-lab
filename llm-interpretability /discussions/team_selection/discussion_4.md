This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To effectively develop a tool for LLM interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, it is crucial to assemble a team with diverse expertise that covers both technical and domain-specific knowledge. Here's the proposed team:

```python
Agent(
    title="Machine Learning Engineer",
    expertise="developing and optimizing large language models and interpretability techniques",
    goal="contribute expertise in building and refining the LLM interpretability framework",
    role="design algorithms and methods to enhance interpretability and ensure the models are transparent and reliable for clinical use",
)

Agent(
    title="Clinical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="understanding electronic health records (EHRs) and phenotype definitions",
    goal="ensure that the interpretability tool aligns with clinical needs and accurately represents phenotype information",
    role="provide insights into clinical data structures and facilitate the integration of LLM outputs with EHR systems",
)

Agent(
    title="Data Visualization Expert",
    expertise="creating visual representations of complex data to enhance understanding",
    goal="design visual interfaces that enhance the interpretability tool's usability and foster trust between clinicians and the model",
    role="develop visualizations that clearly communicate the LLM's decision-making process and output",
)
```

These team members will collaborate to create a robust and reliable LLM interpretability tool that bridges the gap between AI models and clinical practice, ultimately fostering trust and aiding in the accurate definition of phenotypes.
