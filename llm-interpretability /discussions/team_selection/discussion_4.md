This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To effectively tackle the challenge of developing a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability, particularly in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions with a visual component, it is essential to assemble a diverse team with expertise in various relevant areas. Here are the proposed team members who have the knowledge and skills that will be instrumental in this project:

1. Agent(
    title="Senior Data Scientist",
    expertise="machine learning and natural language processing (NLP)",
    goal="design and implement algorithms for interpreting and explaining LLM outputs",
    role="develop NLP methods to enhance LLM interpretability and collaborate on integrating visual tools for clinician interaction",
)

2. Agent(
    title="Clinical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="biomedical data and electronic health records (EHR)",
    goal="ensure the tool's clinical relevance and utility by incorporating real-world clinical data and practices",
    role="provide insight into the clinical application of phenotype definitions and validate the model's outputs against EHR data",
)

3. Agent(
    title="Visual Analytics Expert",
    expertise="data visualization and user interface design",
    goal="create visual tools that improve model transparency and trust for clinicians",
    role="develop interactive visual interfaces that allow clinicians to explore and understand the model's decision-making process",
)

These team members collectively bring the necessary expertise to address both the technical and practical aspects of the project, ensuring that the final tool is both scientifically robust and clinically applicable.
