## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the LLM interpretability approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

For this project, I need to assemble a team with expertise in large language models, biomedical informatics, and user interface design to ensure that we can effectively interpret LLMs and create a tool that is both functional and trustworthy for clinicians. Here are the team members I would like to invite to the discussion:

```python
Agent(
    title="Computational Linguist",
    expertise="large language model development and interpretability",
    goal="develop techniques for interpreting LLM outputs in biomedical contexts",
    role="design and implement interpretability methods specific to electronic phenotype definitions",
)

Agent(
    title="Biomedical Informatics Specialist",
    expertise="electronic health records (EHR) and phenotype extraction",
    goal="integrate LLM interpretability into the process of creating accurate electronic phenotype definitions",
    role="ensure the tool aligns with clinical standards and can effectively extract phenotypes from EHRs",
)

Agent(
    title="Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Designer",
    expertise="user interface design with a focus on trust and usability",
    goal="develop a visual interface that fosters trust and understanding between clinicians and the model",
    role="design and evaluate the visual components of the LLM interpretability tool to maximize user engagement and comprehension",
)
```

These team members will bring a well-rounded set of skills and knowledge to tackle the challenge of making LLMs interpretable and useful for clinicians in the context of electronic phenotype definitions.
