        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust. \n\nYour team has developed four tools to improve the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) used for electronic phenotype definition in clinical notes: \n1. A BioBERT fine-tuning script (`bioBERT.py`) for token-level clinical concept extraction.\n2. A SNOMED CT concept normalization tool (`snomed.py`) that maps extracted text spans to medical ontologies.\n3. A SHAP/LIME visualization tool (`shap_lime.py`) that attributes importance to tokens.\n4. An interactive Plotly dashboard (`plotly.py`) for clinicians to explore model outputs, token attributions, and provide feedback.\n\nYour goal is to design a workflow that takes raw clinical notes and produces an interpretable output containing extracted phenotypes, linked SNOMED terms, SHAP/LIME token attributions, and a visual dashboard for feedback and inspection. This entire process should be modular, support batch processing, and minimize turnaround time for clinicians. \n\nIn particular, interpretability must be maximized **without compromising reliability or traceability**, and outputs should be aligned with real-world ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT) to support clinical integration. The dashboard should allow end-users (e.g., clinicians, data stewards) to review and comment on model outputs and explanations.\n\nPlease determine the ideal order of operations, data flow, feedback loop, and automation opportunities across all four tools. Assume that clinical notes come from a CSV, and model outputs are stored as JSON and CSV files. Be mindful of the time and resource constraints of real-world deployments.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What is the ideal order of operations for using bioBERT, SNOMED normalization, SHAP/LIME explanation, and Plotly visualization on a batch of clinical notes?\n\n2. At what point in the workflow should token-level explanations (e.g., SHAP) be computed\u2014before or after SNOMED mapping\u2014and why?\n\n3. How should outputs from the bioBERT extraction script be formatted and passed to the SNOMED and SHAP/LIME tools to ensure seamless integration?\n\n4. What is the best way to incorporate clinician feedback from the Plotly dashboard back into the system to improve model performance or reliability?\n\n5. How will you handle conflicting or ambiguous SNOMED matches for a given extracted phrase? Should confidence scores guide final mappings?\n\n6. How will this workflow support both batch processing (many notes) and interactive use (single note review)? Should there be a switching mechanism?\n\n7. At the end of the pipeline, how will the system log and store provenance information\u2014i.e., which model produced which outputs using which parameters\u2014for future auditing?\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To address the agenda questions, let's outline a clear and efficient workflow that integrates all components and processes involved in the project. Here's the proposed plan:\n\n### 1. Ideal Order of Operations:\n1. **BioBERT Fine-Tuning and Extraction (`bioBERT.py`):** \n   - Start by running BioBERT on the batch of clinical notes, extracting token-level clinical concepts.\n   \n2. **SNOMED CT Concept Normalization (`snomed.py`):** \n   - Use the extracted concepts to map text spans to SNOMED CT terms, ensuring that each token is aligned with real-world ontologies.\n   \n3. **Token-Level Explanations with SHAP/LIME (`shap_lime.py`):** \n   - Compute SHAP/LIME explanations after SNOMED mapping to provide contextually rich explanations that are grounded in standardized medical terminology.\n   \n4. **Plotly Visualization and Feedback (`plotly.py`):** \n   - Use the interactive Plotly dashboard to visualize outputs, with linked SNOMED terms and token attributions, allowing clinicians to explore and provide feedback.\n\n### 2. Timing for Token-Level Explanations:\n- **After SNOMED Mapping:** \n  - Calculating SHAP/LIME attributions post-SNOMED mapping ensures that explanations are directly tied to standardized medical concepts, enhancing interpretability and reliability.\n\n### 3. Data Formatting and Integration:\n- **BioBERT to SNOMED and SHAP/LIME:**\n  - Outputs from the BioBERT extraction should be structured as JSON objects containing token information and positions. This JSON can then be directly consumed by SNOMED normalization and SHAP/LIME tools. Ensure that standardized field names are used for seamless integration.\n\n### 4. Incorporating Clinician Feedback:\n- **Feedback Loop:**\n  - Implement a mechanism within the Plotly dashboard where clinicians can annotate or comment on outputs. These annotations should be stored in a version-controlled database, allowing for iterative model updates and the refinement of extraction rules.\n\n### 5. Handling Conflicting or Ambiguous SNOMED Matches:\n- **Resolution Strategy:**\n  - When conflicts arise, use confidence scores to prioritize mappings. If ambiguity remains, the dashboard should prompt clinicians to manually confirm or revise the mappings. This interaction can be logged for future model training.\n\n### 6. Supporting Batch and Interactive Processing:\n- **Switching Mechanism:**\n  - Implement a dual-mode operation: a batch processing pipeline for regular, large-scale data, and an interactive mode for single-note review. This can be managed via a configuration file or command-line arguments.\n\n### 7. Logging and Provenance:\n- **Provenance Tracking:**\n  - Log every processing step, including model versions, parameters, and timestamped outputs, in a centralized database. This information should be easily accessible for audit purposes and contribute to model reliability and transparency.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following this structured approach, the workflow will be robust, scalable, and conducive to clinician trust and collaboration. This plan ensures that interpretability and real-world applicability are at the forefront, maximizing our scientific impact in the realm of biomedical AI research."
