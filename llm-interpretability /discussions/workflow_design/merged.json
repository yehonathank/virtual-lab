        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.\n\nHere are summaries of the previous meetings:\n\n[begin summary 1]\n\nTo address the agenda questions, let's outline a clear and efficient workflow that integrates all components and processes involved in the project. Here's the proposed plan:\n\n### 1. Ideal Order of Operations:\n1. **BioBERT Fine-Tuning and Extraction (`bioBERT.py`):** \n   - Start by running BioBERT on the batch of clinical notes, extracting token-level clinical concepts.\n   \n2. **SNOMED CT Concept Normalization (`snomed.py`):** \n   - Use the extracted concepts to map text spans to SNOMED CT terms, ensuring that each token is aligned with real-world ontologies.\n   \n3. **Token-Level Explanations with SHAP/LIME (`shap_lime.py`):** \n   - Compute SHAP/LIME explanations after SNOMED mapping to provide contextually rich explanations that are grounded in standardized medical terminology.\n   \n4. **Plotly Visualization and Feedback (`plotly.py`):** \n   - Use the interactive Plotly dashboard to visualize outputs, with linked SNOMED terms and token attributions, allowing clinicians to explore and provide feedback.\n\n### 2. Timing for Token-Level Explanations:\n- **After SNOMED Mapping:** \n  - Calculating SHAP/LIME attributions post-SNOMED mapping ensures that explanations are directly tied to standardized medical concepts, enhancing interpretability and reliability.\n\n### 3. Data Formatting and Integration:\n- **BioBERT to SNOMED and SHAP/LIME:**\n  - Outputs from the BioBERT extraction should be structured as JSON objects containing token information and positions. This JSON can then be directly consumed by SNOMED normalization and SHAP/LIME tools. Ensure that standardized field names are used for seamless integration.\n\n### 4. Incorporating Clinician Feedback:\n- **Feedback Loop:**\n  - Implement a mechanism within the Plotly dashboard where clinicians can annotate or comment on outputs. These annotations should be stored in a version-controlled database, allowing for iterative model updates and the refinement of extraction rules.\n\n### 5. Handling Conflicting or Ambiguous SNOMED Matches:\n- **Resolution Strategy:**\n  - When conflicts arise, use confidence scores to prioritize mappings. If ambiguity remains, the dashboard should prompt clinicians to manually confirm or revise the mappings. This interaction can be logged for future model training.\n\n### 6. Supporting Batch and Interactive Processing:\n- **Switching Mechanism:**\n  - Implement a dual-mode operation: a batch processing pipeline for regular, large-scale data, and an interactive mode for single-note review. This can be managed via a configuration file or command-line arguments.\n\n### 7. Logging and Provenance:\n- **Provenance Tracking:**\n  - Log every processing step, including model versions, parameters, and timestamped outputs, in a centralized database. This information should be easily accessible for audit purposes and contribute to model reliability and transparency.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following this structured approach, the workflow will be robust, scalable, and conducive to clinician trust and collaboration. This plan ensures that interpretability and real-world applicability are at the forefront, maximizing our scientific impact in the realm of biomedical AI research.\n\n[end summary 1]\n\n[begin summary 2]\n\nLet's address each agenda question systematically to design an efficient and effective workflow for enhancing LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions:\n\n1. **Ideal Order of Operations:**\n   - **Step 1:** **BioBERT Fine-Tuning and Concept Extraction:** Start by processing the batch of clinical notes with the `bioBERT.py` script to perform token-level clinical concept extraction.\n   - **Step 2:** **SNOMED CT Concept Normalization:** Use the `snomed.py` tool to map the extracted text spans to their corresponding SNOMED CT terms. This ensures alignment with medical ontologies early in the process.\n   - **Step 3:** **SHAP/LIME Explanation:** Apply the `shap_lime.py` tool to generate token-level explanations. By doing this after SNOMED mapping, explanations are more contextually relevant to standardized clinical terms.\n   - **Step 4:** **Plotly Visualization:** Finally, visualize the results in the `plotly.py` dashboard, where clinicians can interact with outputs and provide feedback.\n\n2. **Timing for Token-Level Explanations:**\n   - Compute token-level explanations **after SNOMED mapping**. This ensures that the attribution of importance is directly linked to standardized clinical concepts, making the explanations more meaningful and reliable from a clinical standpoint.\n\n3. **Formatting and Integration of Outputs:**\n   - The output from `bioBERT.py` should be a structured JSON file containing extracted tokens and their predicted clinical concepts. This JSON can be directly consumed by `snomed.py` for normalization and then passed to `shap_lime.py` for generating explanations. Consistent JSON object keys must be maintained across scripts for seamless integration.\n\n4. **Incorporating Clinician Feedback:**\n   - Design the Plotly dashboard to capture clinician feedback on both the accuracy of extracted phenotypes and the relevance of SHAP/LIME attributions. Feedback should be logged in a structured format (e.g., JSON) and processed by a feedback module that can fine-tune the BioBERT model and adjust the mapping rules in `snomed.py`.\n\n5. **Handling Conflicting SNOMED Matches:**\n   - Use confidence scores to guide the final mapping of extracted phrases to SNOMED terms. In cases of conflict or ambiguity, the system should present options to the clinician for manual selection in the dashboard. Additionally, maintain a log of such instances to improve the normalization tool.\n\n6. **Supporting Batch and Interactive Use:**\n   - Implement a dual-mode system:\n     - **Batch Mode:** For processing multiple notes, automate the complete pipeline, from extraction to dashboard visualization, minimizing manual intervention.\n     - **Interactive Mode:** Allow clinicians to input a single note and immediately receive processed outputs in the dashboard, facilitating detailed review. A user interface toggle or command-line parameter can switch between modes.\n\n7. **Logging and Storing Provenance Information:**\n   - Implement a logging mechanism that records the model version, parameter settings, input data, and output results for each run. Store this provenance information in a centralized database or a structured log file (e.g., JSON) to ensure traceability and facilitate future audits.\n\nBy following this workflow, we can ensure that the tool maximizes interpretability while maintaining reliability and traceability, ultimately fostering clinician trust in the system.\n\n[end summary 2]\n\n[begin summary 3]\n\n### Response to the Agenda\n\n1. **Ideal Order of Operations:**\n\n   - **Step 1: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**\n     - Clinical notes are read from a CSV file and preprocessed for tokenization and normalization (e.g., handling misspellings, standardizing terms).\n\n   - **Step 2: BioBERT Token-Level Clinical Concept Extraction**\n     - Use `bioBERT.py` to extract token-level clinical concepts from the preprocessed notes.\n\n   - **Step 3: SNOMED CT Concept Normalization**\n     - Pass the extracted concepts to `snomed.py` to map them to SNOMED CT terms, reducing ambiguity and enhancing interpretability.\n\n   - **Step 4: SHAP/LIME Token-Level Explanation**\n     - Apply `shap_lime.py` to compute token-level importance scores, which can be performed either before or after SNOMED mapping, depending on the desired granularity of explanations.\n\n   - **Step 5: Data Packaging for Visualization**\n     - Format all outputs (extracted phenotypes, SNOMED terms, SHAP/LIME attributions) into a JSON file for visual inspection.\n\n   - **Step 6: Interactive Visualization and Feedback**\n     - Load data into the `plotly.py` dashboard for clinician exploration, review, and feedback.\n\n2. **Timing of Token-Level Explanations:**\n\n   - Token-level explanations should ideally be computed **after SNOMED mapping**. This ensures that the importance scores are aligned with clinically meaningful concepts, providing clearer insights into the reasoning behind the model\u2019s predictions and allowing clinicians to trace back from standardized terms.\n\n3. **Output Formatting and Integration:**\n\n   - The output from `bioBERT.py` should be formatted as a JSON object containing the extracted tokens, their positions, and preliminary confidence scores. This object is then passed to `snomed.py`, where each concept is mapped to a SNOMED CT term, creating a structured JSON enriched with semantic information.\n   - This enriched JSON is subsequently used by `shap_lime.py` to generate importance scores, which are merged back into the JSON structure, ready for visualization.\n\n4. **Incorporating Clinician Feedback:**\n\n   - The Plotly dashboard should include a feature that allows clinicians to annotate outputs, suggest corrections, and indicate trust levels. This feedback can be logged and processed to refine model performance by retraining BioBERT with clinician-approved annotations or adjusting SNOMED mappings based on ground truth corrections.\n\n5. **Handling Conflicting SNOMED Matches:**\n\n   - Implement a confidence scoring system for SNOMED matches. When conflicts arise, prioritize matches with higher confidence scores. If ambiguity persists, flag these cases for manual review by clinicians, who can provide input through the dashboard.\n\n6. **Support for Batch and Interactive Processing:**\n\n   - Design the workflow to accommodate both **batch processing** and **interactive use cases**. Batch processing can be scheduled to run on a server, processing multiple notes and generating comprehensive reports. For interactive use, incorporate a real-time processing option within the dashboard, enabling clinicians to analyze individual notes as needed.\n   - Implement a switching mechanism that allows users to toggle between batch and interactive modes, ensuring flexibility depending on the clinical context.\n\n7. **Logging and Storing Provenance Information:**\n\n   - Establish a logging system that captures details about each operation, including model versions, parameters, and timestamps. Store this provenance information in a database, linked to each output file, enabling future audits and reproducibility.\n   - Ensure that all modifications, including clinician feedback and any resulting changes to model parameters or mappings, are logged to maintain a comprehensive history of the system\u2019s evolution.\n\nThis structured approach aims to maximize interpretability, reliability, and clinician trust while supporting scalability and adaptability for different clinical environments.\n\n[end summary 3]\n\n[begin summary 4]\n\n### Agenda Responses:\n\n1. **Ideal Order of Operations:**\n\n   The ideal workflow begins with the **BioBERT fine-tuning script** (`bioBERT.py`) for token-level clinical concept extraction from raw clinical notes. Once the concepts are extracted, the next step is **SNOMED CT concept normalization** (`snomed.py`) to map these extracted text spans to standardized medical ontologies. Following normalization, we compute **token-level explanations** using SHAP/LIME (`shap_lime.py`) to attribute importance to the tokens. Finally, the results are visualized and made interactive using the **Plotly dashboard** (`plotly.py`), where clinicians can explore model outputs and provide feedback.\n\n2. **Timing of Token-Level Explanations:**\n\n   Token-level explanations (e.g., SHAP) should be computed **after SNOMED mapping**. The rationale is that after mapping, the model\u2019s output is closer to a real-world application, thus providing clinicians with explanations tied directly to clinically relevant concepts. This ensures interpretability in a context clinicians understand and maximizes trust by aligning explanations with standardized terms.\n\n3. **Integration Formatting:**\n\n   Outputs from the BioBERT extraction should be formatted as JSON to ensure structured data flow. This JSON should include token spans and their corresponding confidence scores. This format will seamlessly integrate with SNOMED and SHAP/LIME tools by providing structured data for mapping and explanation. The JSON can then be enriched with SNOMED IDs and explanation scores before visualization.\n\n4. **Incorporating Clinician Feedback:**\n\n   Clinician feedback from the Plotly dashboard can be incorporated through an annotation mechanism embedded within the dashboard. Feedback can be recorded as JSON, which specifies the clinician\u2019s comments on interpretations, corrections, or confirmations. This data should be fed back into the model training pipeline to update the weights and improve future model iterations, enhancing reliability and accuracy.\n\n5. **Handling Conflicting SNOMED Matches:**\n\n   In cases of conflicting or ambiguous SNOMED matches, confidence scores should guide the final mappings. A decision threshold can be established wherein matches with scores below a certain level are flagged for clinician review. This ensures that less confident mappings are verified by experts before integration into clinical workflows.\n\n6. **Supporting Batch and Interactive Processes:**\n\n   The workflow can support both batch processing and interactive use by implementing a flexible processing framework that includes a switching mechanism. This can be done through command-line arguments or a configuration file that specifies the batch or single-note mode. Batch processes can run through a queue system, while interactive use can be handled in near real-time within the dashboard.\n\n7. **Logging and Storing Provenance Information:**\n\n   At the end of the pipeline, provenance information, such as the model version, parameter settings, and timestamp, should be logged alongside the outputs in a database or structured log file. This information should be linked with a unique identifier for each processed note, ensuring transparency and traceability for future auditing and analysis.\n\nBy structuring the workflow in this way, we ensure that the tool is robust, scalable, and aligned with clinical needs while addressing interpretability and reliability concerns.\n\n[end summary 4]\n\n[begin summary 5]\n\nLet's address each of the agenda questions systematically:\n\n1. **Ideal Order of Operations:**\n   - **Step 1:** Preprocess Clinical Notes - Extract clinical notes from the CSV and prepare them for processing.\n   - **Step 2:** BioBERT Token-Level Clinical Concept Extraction - Use `bioBERT.py` to extract relevant clinical concepts from the notes.\n   - **Step 3:** SNOMED CT Concept Normalization - Pass extracted concepts from BioBERT to `snomed.py` for mapping to SNOMED CT terms.\n   - **Step 4:** SHAP/LIME Explanation - Use the `shap_lime.py` tool to compute token-level explanations for the mapped SNOMED concepts.\n   - **Step 5:** Plotly Visualization - Load results into the `plotly.py` dashboard for interactive review, visualization, and feedback from clinicians.\n   - **Step 6:** Feedback Integration - Gather clinician feedback from the dashboard to iterate and improve the models.\n\n2. **Timing for Token-Level Explanations (SHAP/LIME):**\n   - Token-level explanations should ideally be computed **after SNOMED mapping**. This ensures that explanations are focused on standardized medical concepts, making them more interpretable and relevant to clinicians. This approach also helps in identifying which SNOMED terms are most influential in the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Output Formatting for Seamless Integration:**\n   - Outputs from `bioBERT.py` should be structured as JSON files containing token-level information with associated scores. These should include metadata like sentence position and context. This JSON can be directly ingested by `snomed.py` to map to SNOMED terms, which will, in turn, output another JSON with SNOMED IDs and descriptions for `shap_lime.py`. Consistency in the data structure is key.\n\n4. **Incorporating Clinician Feedback:**\n   - Clinician feedback should be collected through the Plotly dashboard and stored in a database with links to the specific model outputs they reviewed. This feedback can be used to retrain models or adjust SNOMED mappings. Implement a mechanism for annotators to flag incorrect mappings or explanations directly, and prioritize recurring feedback in model updates.\n\n5. **Handling Conflicting SNOMED Matches:**\n   - For conflicting or ambiguous SNOMED matches, use confidence scores to guide final decisions. Incorporate a threshold below which a match is flagged for review. Additionally, provide clinicians with options to select the most appropriate term from a list of probable matches via the dashboard.\n\n6. **Supporting Batch Processing and Interactive Use:**\n   - Implement a mode-switching mechanism within the application to toggle between batch processing and interactive single-note review. For batch processing, enable parallel processing of notes to enhance efficiency. For single-note review, prioritize real-time processing and immediate feedback integration within the dashboard.\n\n7. **Logging and Storing Provenance Information:**\n   - Create a logging mechanism to store details about the models used (e.g., BioBERT version, SNOMED database version), parameters, timestamps, and data transformations in a database. Each output should be tagged with a unique identifier linking back to these logs for auditing purposes. Ensure this provenance information can be easily retrieved and reviewed by stakeholders.\n\nBy following this structured workflow, we maximize interpretability and reliability while effectively integrating clinician feedback. This setup also allows for continuous improvement and scalability in both batch and interactive settings.\n\n[end summary 5]\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nPlease read the summaries of multiple separate meetings about the same agenda. Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.\n\nAs a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust. \n\nYour team has developed four tools to improve the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) used for electronic phenotype definition in clinical notes: \n1. A BioBERT fine-tuning script (`bioBERT.py`) for token-level clinical concept extraction.\n2. A SNOMED CT concept normalization tool (`snomed.py`) that maps extracted text spans to medical ontologies.\n3. A SHAP/LIME visualization tool (`shap_lime.py`) that attributes importance to tokens.\n4. An interactive Plotly dashboard (`plotly.py`) for clinicians to explore model outputs, token attributions, and provide feedback.\n\nYour goal is to design a workflow that takes raw clinical notes and produces an interpretable output containing extracted phenotypes, linked SNOMED terms, SHAP/LIME token attributions, and a visual dashboard for feedback and inspection. This entire process should be modular, support batch processing, and minimize turnaround time for clinicians. \n\nIn particular, interpretability must be maximized **without compromising reliability or traceability**, and outputs should be aligned with real-world ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT) to support clinical integration. The dashboard should allow end-users (e.g., clinicians, data stewards) to review and comment on model outputs and explanations.\n\nPlease determine the ideal order of operations, data flow, feedback loop, and automation opportunities across all four tools. Assume that clinical notes come from a CSV, and model outputs are stored as JSON and CSV files. Be mindful of the time and resource constraints of real-world deployments.\n\nAs a reference, here are the agenda questions from those meetings, which must be answered here as well:\n\n1. What is the ideal order of operations for using bioBERT, SNOMED normalization, SHAP/LIME explanation, and Plotly visualization on a batch of clinical notes?\n\n2. At what point in the workflow should token-level explanations (e.g., SHAP) be computed\u2014before or after SNOMED mapping\u2014and why?\n\n3. How should outputs from the bioBERT extraction script be formatted and passed to the SNOMED and SHAP/LIME tools to ensure seamless integration?\n\n4. What is the best way to incorporate clinician feedback from the Plotly dashboard back into the system to improve model performance or reliability?\n\n5. How will you handle conflicting or ambiguous SNOMED matches for a given extracted phrase? Should confidence scores guide final mappings?\n\n6. How will this workflow support both batch processing (many notes) and interactive use (single note review)? Should there be a switching mechanism?\n\n7. At the end of the pipeline, how will the system log and store provenance information\u2014i.e., which model produced which outputs using which parameters\u2014for future auditing?\n\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."
