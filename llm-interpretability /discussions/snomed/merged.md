   - **User Guidance**: Enhanced error messages to give users more specific guidance on troubleshooting issues like API authentication or network problems.

4. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - **User Experience**: Added a specific usage example to guide users on how to run the script with appropriate parameters.

5. **Documentation and Comments**:
   - **Examples**: Included more detailed comments and ensured that docstrings explain the purpose and expected input/output of each function. Consider further documentation in a separate file if needed.

6. **Output Structure and Validation**:
   - **Robustness**: The script handles potential missing data gracefully, ensuring that CSV output remains valid even if some data is unavailable.

7. **Integration and Modularity**:
   - **Modular Design**: The script is structured to allow easy integration into larger systems. Further modularization could be achieved by separating API interactions and file operations if required.

These enhancements aim to make the script more practical, user-friendly, and ready for real-world application in the context of LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions.

### Key Enhancements and Considerations:
1. **Error Handling with Retry Logic:** The script now includes a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for handling transient API request failures, enhancing robustness.
2. **Ranking Criteria Explanation:** The ranking logic prioritizes concepts that are fully defined and active. This approach helps ensure that the most relevant and up-to-date concepts are selected, improving the accuracy of mappings.
3. **Confidence Score Derivation:** The confidence score reflects the activity status and definition status of SNOMED CT concepts, providing a measure of the reliability of the mapping.
4. **Integration Strategy with LLM Pipeline:** For integration, the script outputs standardized CSV data that can be easily consumed by downstream components of the LLM pipeline. A separate integration document should outline how this script fits into the larger system, describing expected input and output data formats.
5. **Documentation for Data Privacy and Security:** Ensure that any clinical data handling in this script complies with data protection regulations like HIPAA. API credentials should be managed securely, for example, using environment variables or a secure configuration file.
6. **Scalability Considerations:** The `max_workers` parameter in `ThreadPoolExecutor` can be adjusted to better fit the deployment environment's resources, optimizing performance.

By implementing these enhancements, the script becomes more reliable and ready for real-world application, aligning with the agenda's goals of developing a robust tool for LLM interpretability in clinical informatics.

[end summary 5]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Please read the summaries of multiple separate meetings about the same agenda. Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.

As a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:


You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust. Now you must use the SNOMED CT API to map model outputs (clinical entities extracted from text) to valid standardized medical concepts. Write a complete Python script that:
1. Takes as input a list of free-text clinical concepts (e.g., “chronic kidney disease”, “elevated creatinine”).
2. Queries the SNOMED CT browser API (or a local terminology server) to return the best matching SNOMED CT concept ID for each term.
3. Includes logic to rank or disambiguate multiple matches (e.g., by semantic type or frequency).
4. Saves output as a CSV file with the following columns: raw_text, snomed_id, concept_name, confidence_score.
Ensure your implementation can be integrated into a larger LLM pipeline to support grounding of phenotype terms in standardized clinical vocabularies.


As a reference, here are the agenda rules from those meetings, which must be followed here as well:

1. Your code must be self-contained (with appropriate imports) and complete.

2. Your code may not include any undefined or unimplemented variables or functions.

3. Your code may not include any pseudocode; it must be fully functioning code.

4. Your code may not include any hard-coded examples.

5. If your code needs user-provided values, write code to parse those values from the command line.

6. Your code must be high quality, well-engineered, efficient, and well-documented (including docstrings, comments, and Python type hints if using Python).
