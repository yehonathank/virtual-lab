This script needs to be improved. Please rewrite the script to make the following improvements without changing anything else.\n\n1. Add caching using functools.lru_cache or diskcache so that repeated concept queries don't re-hit the API.\n2. Allow batch querying of concept terms (if supported by the API), or group terms by frequency before querying.\n3. Return a JSON object as well as the CSV for easier integration with downstream Python pipelines.\n4. Move ranking logic into a separate function and add optional CLI flags to choose ranking strategies (e.g. shortest term, most active, fully defined).\n\nClinical Informatics Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To address the agenda and improve the Python script for querying SNOMED CT, we can implement the following enhancements:\n\n1. **Caching with `functools.lru_cache` or `diskcache`:** This will help reduce redundant API calls for repeated concept queries, improving efficiency and reducing load on the SNOMED CT API.\n\n2. **Batch Querying or Frequency Grouping:** If the SNOMED CT API supports batch querying, we can modify the script to send multiple terms in a single request. Alternatively, grouping terms by frequency before querying can optimize the process by prioritizing more common terms.\n\n3. **Return JSON Object:** In addition to saving results to a CSV file, returning a JSON object will facilitate easier integration with downstream Python pipelines, allowing for more flexible data handling.\n\n4. **Separate Ranking Logic and CLI Flags for Ranking Strategies:** By moving the ranking logic into a separate function, we can add flexibility to the script. Introducing optional CLI flags will allow users to select different ranking strategies, such as prioritizing the shortest term, most active concepts, or fully defined concepts.\n\nHere's a revised version of the script incorporating these improvements:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport csv\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport logging\nimport json\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Tuple\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed\nfrom requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth\nfrom functools import lru_cache\nimport diskcache as dc\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n# Configuration for SNOMED CT API\nAPI_USERNAME = \"your_username\"  #
