Title = Ontological representation, classification and data-driven computing of phenotypes

The successful determination and analysis of phenotypes plays a key role in the diagnostic process, the evaluation of risk factors and the recruitment of participants for clinical and epidemiological studies. The development of computable phenotype algorithms to solve these tasks is a challenging problem, caused by various reasons. Firstly, the term ‘phenotype’ has no generally agreed definition and its meaning depends on context. Secondly, the phenotypes are most commonly specified as non-computable descriptive documents. Recent attempts have shown that ontologies are a suitable way to handle phenotypes and that they can support clinical research and decision making.

The SMITH Consortium is dedicated to rapidly establish an integrative medical informatics framework to provide physicians with the best available data and knowledge and enable innovative use of healthcare data for research and treatment optimisation. In the context of a methodological use case ‘phenotype pipeline’ (PheP), a technology to automatically generate phenotype classifications and annotations based on electronic health records (EHR) is developed. A large series of phenotype algorithms will be implemented. This implies that for each algorithm a classification scheme and its input variables have to be defined. Furthermore, a phenotype engine is required to evaluate and execute developed algorithms.

In this article, we present a Core Ontology of Phenotypes (COP) and the software Phenotype Manager (PhenoMan), which implements a novel ontology-based method to model, classify and compute phenotypes from already available data. Our solution includes an enhanced iterative reasoning process combining classification tasks with mathematical calculations at runtime. The ontology as well as the reasoning method were successfully evaluated with selected phenotypes including SOFA score, socio-economic status, body surface area and WHO BMI classification based on available medical data.

We developed a novel ontology-based method to model phenotypes of living beings with the aim of automated phenotype reasoning based on available data. This new approach can be used in clinical context, e.g., for supporting the diagnostic process, evaluating risk factors, and recruiting appropriate participants for clinical and epidemiological studies.

Title = Towards linked open gene mutations data

With the advent of high-throughput technologies, a great wealth of variation data is being produced. Such information may constitute the basis for correlation analyses between genotypes and phenotypes and, in the future, for personalized medicine. Several databases on gene variation exist, but this kind of information is still scarce in the Semantic Web framework.

In this paper, we discuss issues related to the integration of mutation data in the Linked Open Data infrastructure, part of the Semantic Web framework. We present the development of a mapping from the IARC TP53 Mutation database to RDF and the implementation of servers publishing this data.

A version of the IARC TP53 Mutation database implemented in a relational database was used as first test set. Automatic mappings to RDF were first created by using D2RQ and later manually refined by introducing concepts and properties from domain vocabularies and ontologies, as well as links to Linked Open Data implementations of various systems of biomedical interest.

Since D2RQ query performances are lower than those that can be achieved by using an RDF archive, generated data was also loaded into a dedicated system based on tools from the Jena software suite.

We have implemented a D2RQ Server for TP53 mutation data, providing data on a subset of the IARC database, including gene variations, somatic mutations, and bibliographic references. The server allows to browse the RDF graph by using links both between classes and to external systems. An alternative interface offers improved performances for SPARQL queries. The resulting data can be explored by using any Semantic Web browser or application.

This has been the first case of a mutation database exposed as Linked Data. A revised version of our prototype, including further concepts and IARC TP53 Mutation database data sets, is under development.

The publication of variation information as Linked Data opens new perspectives: the exploitation of SPARQL searches on mutation data and other biological databases may support data retrieval which is presently not possible. Moreover, reasoning on integrated variation data may support discoveries towards personalized medicine.

Title = An analysis of entity normalization evaluation biases in specialized domains

Entity normalization is an important information extraction task which has recently gained attention, particularly in the clinical/biomedical and life science domains. On several datasets, state-of-the-art methods perform rather well on popular benchmarks. Yet, we argue that the task is far from resolved.

We have selected two gold standard corpora and two state-of-the-art methods to highlight some evaluation biases. We present non-exhaustive initial findings on the existence of evaluation problems of the entity normalization task. 

Our analysis suggests better evaluation practices to support the methodological research in this field.

Title = Named Entity Recognition and Relation Detection for Biomedical Information Extraction

The number of scientific publications in the literature is steadily growing, containing our knowledge in the biomedical, health, and clinical sciences. Since there is currently no automatic archiving of the obtained results, much of this information remains buried in textual details not readily available for further usage or analysis. For this reason, natural language processing (NLP) and text mining methods are used for information extraction from such publications. In this paper, we review practices for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Detection (RD), allowing, e.g., to identify interactions between proteins and drugs or genes and diseases. This information can be integrated into networks to summarize large-scale details on a particular biomedical or clinical problem, which is then amenable for easy data management and further analysis. Furthermore, we survey novel deep learning methods that have recently been introduced for such tasks.

Title = First Organoid Intelligence (OI) workshop to form an OI community

The brain is arguably the most powerful computation system known. It is extremely efficient in processing large amounts of information and can discern signals from noise, adapt, and filter faulty information all while running on only 20 watts of power. The human brain's processing efficiency, progressive learning, and plasticity are unmatched by any computer system. Recent advances in stem cell technology have elevated the field of cell culture to higher levels of complexity, such as the development of three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids that recapitulate human brain functionality better than traditional monolayer cell systems. Organoid Intelligence (OI) aims to harness the innate biological capabilities of brain organoids for biocomputing and synthetic intelligence by interfacing them with computer technology. With the latest strides in stem cell technology, bioengineering, and machine learning, we can explore the ability of brain organoids to compute, and store given information (input), execute a task (output), and study how this affects the structural and functional connections in the organoids themselves. Furthermore, understanding how learning generates and changes patterns of connectivity in organoids can shed light on the early stages of cognition in the human brain. Investigating and understanding these concepts is an enormous, multidisciplinary endeavor that necessitates the engagement of both the scientific community and the public. Thus, on Feb 22–24 of 2022, the Johns Hopkins University held the first Organoid Intelligence Workshop to form an OI Community and to lay out the groundwork for the establishment of OI as a new scientific discipline. The potential of OI to revolutionize computing, neurological research, and drug development was discussed, along with a vision and roadmap for its development over the coming decade.

Title = Digital approaches in post-COVID healthcare: a systematic review of technological innovations in disease management

Post-COVID conditions (PCC) emerged during the pandemic, prompting a rise in the use of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) to manage lockdowns and hospital overcrowding. Real-time tracking and information analyses were crucial to strengthening the global research response. This study aims to map the use of modern digital approaches in estimating the prevalence, predicting, diagnosing, treating, monitoring, and prognosis of PCC. This review was conducted by searching PubMed and Scopus databases for keywords and synonyms related to DHTs, Smart Healthcare Systems, and PCC based on the World Health Organization definition. Articles published from 1 January 2020 to 21 May 2024 were screened for eligibility based on predefined inclusion criteria, and the PRISMA framework was used to report the findings from the retained studies. Our search identified 377 studies, but we retained 23 studies that used DHTs, artificial intelligence (AI), and infodemiology to diagnose, estimate prevalence, predict, treat, and monitor PCC. Notably, a few interventions used infodemics to identify the clinical presentations of the disease, while most utilized Electronic Health Records and AI tools to estimate diagnosis and prevalence. However, we found that AI tools were scarcely used for monitoring symptoms, and studies involving SHS were non-existent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These findings show several DHTs used in healthcare, but there is an urgent need for further research in SHS for complex health conditions, particularly in LMICs. Enhancing DHTs and integrating AI and infodemiology provide promising avenues for managing epidemics and related complications, such as PCC.

Title =  Smart Medical Information Technology for Healthcare (SMITH) * 

 Introduction: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on the German Medical Informatics Initiative. “Smart Medical Information Technology for Healthcare (SMITH)” is one of four consortia funded by the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MI-I) to create an alliance of universities, university hospitals, research institutions and IT companies. SMITH’s goals are to establish Data Integration Centers (DICs) at each SMITH partner hospital and to implement use cases which demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. 

 Objectives: To give insight into architectural design issues underlying SMITH data integration and to introduce the use cases to be implemented. 

 Governance and Policies: SMITH implements a federated approach as well for its governance structure as for its information system architecture. SMITH has designed a generic concept for its data integration centers. They share identical services and functionalities to take best advantage of the interoperability architectures and of the data use and access process planned. The DICs provide access to the local hospitals’ Electronic Medical Records (EMR). This is based on data trustee and privacy management services. DIC staff will curate and amend EMR data in the Health Data Storage. 

 Methodology and Architectural Framework: To share medical and research data, SMITH’s information system is based on communication and storage standards. We use the Reference Model of the Open Archival Information System and will consistently implement profiles of Integrating the Health Care Enterprise (IHE) and Health Level Seven (HL7) standards. Standard terminologies will be applied. The SMITH Market Place will be used for devising agreements on data access and distribution. 3LGM 2 for enterprise architecture modeling supports a consistent development process. 

The DIC reference architecture determines the services, applications and the standards-based communication links needed for efficiently supporting the ingesting, data nourishing, trustee, privacy management and data transfer tasks of the SMITH DICs. The reference architecture is adopted at the local sites. Data sharing services and the market place enable interoperability.

 Use Cases: The methodological use case “Phenotype Pipeline” (PheP) constructs algorithms for annotations and analyses of patient-related phenotypes according to classification rules or statistical models based on structured data. Unstructured textual data will be subject to natural language processing to permit integration into the phenotyping algorithms. The clinical use case “Algorithmic Surveillance of ICU Patients” (ASIC) focusses on patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A model-based decision-support system will give advice for mechanical ventilation. The clinical use case HELP develops a “hospital-wide electronic medical record-based computerized decision support system to improve outcomes of patients with blood-stream infections” (HELP). ASIC and HELP use the PheP. The clinical benefit of the use cases ASIC and HELP will be demonstrated in a change of care clinical trial based on a step wedge design. 

 Discussion: SMITH’s strength is the modular, reusable IT architecture based on interoperability standards, the integration of the hospitals’ information management departments and the public-private partnership. The project aims at sustainability beyond the first 4-year funding period.

Title = Can reproducibility be improved in clinical natural language processing? A study of 7 clinical NLP suites

The increasing complexity of data streams and computational processes in modern clinical health information systems makes reproducibility challenging. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) pipelines are routinely leveraged for the secondary use of data. Workflow management systems (WMS) have been widely used in bioinformatics to handle the reproducibility bottleneck.

To evaluate if WMS and other bioinformatics practices could impact the reproducibility of clinical NLP frameworks.

Based on the literature across multiple researcho fields (NLP, bioinformatics and clinical informatics) we selected articles which (1) review reproducibility practices and (2) highlight a set of rules or guidelines to ensure tool or pipeline reproducibility. We aggregate insight from the literature to define reproducibility recommendations. Finally, we assess the compliance of 7 NLP frameworks to the recommendations.

We identified 40 reproducibility features from 8 selected articles. Frameworks based on WMS match more than 50% of features (26 features for LAPPS Grid, 22 features for OpenMinted) compared to 18 features for current clinical NLP framework (cTakes, CLAMP) and 17 features for GATE, ScispaCy, and Textflows.

34 recommendations are endorsed by at least 2 articles from our selection. Overall, 15 features were adopted by every NLP Framework. Nevertheless, frameworks based on WMS had a better compliance with the features.

NLP frameworks could benefit from lessons learned from the bioinformatics field (eg, public repositories of curated tools and workflows or use of containers for shareability) to enhance the reproducibility in a clinical setting.

Title = Orchestrating differential data access for translational research: a pilot implementation

Translational researchers need robust IT solutions to access a range of data types, varying from public data sets to pseudonymised patient information with restricted access, provided on a case by case basis. The reason for this complication is that managing access policies to sensitive human data must consider issues of data confidentiality, identifiability, extent of consent, and data usage agreements. All these ethical, social and legal aspects must be incorporated into a differential management of restricted access to sensitive data.

In this paper we present a pilot system that uses several common open source software components in a novel combination to coordinate access to heterogeneous biomedical data repositories containing open data (open access) as well as sensitive data (restricted access) in the domain of biobanking and biosample research. Our approach is based on a digital identity federation and software to manage resource access entitlements.

Open source software components were assembled and configured in such a way that they allow for different ways of restricted access according to the protection needs of the data. We have tested the resulting pilot infrastructure and assessed its performance, feasibility and reproducibility.

Common open source software components are sufficient to allow for the creation of a secure system for differential access to sensitive data. The implementation of this system is exemplary for researchers facing similar requirements for restricted access data. Here we report experience and lessons learnt of our pilot implementation, which may be useful for similar use cases. Furthermore, we discuss possible extensions for more complex scenarios.

Title = A Review of the Clinical Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Abdominal Imaging

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a topic of substantial interest for radiologists in recent years. Although many of the first clinical applications were in the neuro, cardiothoracic, and breast imaging subspecialties, the number of investigated and real-world applications of body imaging has been increasing, with more than 30 FDA-approved algorithms now available for applications in the abdomen and pelvis. In this manuscript, we explore some of the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning, review major functions that AI algorithms may perform, introduce current and potential future applications of AI in abdominal imaging, provide a basic understanding of the pathways by which AI algorithms can receive FDA approval, and explore some of the challenges with the implementation of AI in clinical practice.

Title = Clinical applications of artificial intelligence in sleep medicine: a sleep clinician’s perspective

The past few years have seen a rapid emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technology in the field of sleep medicine. AI refers to the capability of computer systems to perform tasks conventionally considered to require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, decision-making, and visual recognition of patterns and objects. The practice of sleep tracking and measuring physiological signals in sleep is widely practiced. Therefore, sleep monitoring in both the laboratory and ambulatory environments results in the accrual of massive amounts of data that uniquely positions the field of sleep medicine to gain from AI.

The purpose of this article is to provide a concise overview of relevant terminology, definitions, and use cases of AI in sleep medicine. This was supplemented by a thorough review of relevant published literature.

Artificial intelligence has several applications in sleep medicine including sleep and respiratory event scoring in the sleep laboratory, diagnosing and managing sleep disorders, and population health. While still in its nascent stage, there are several challenges which preclude AI’s generalizability and wide-reaching clinical applications. Overcoming these challenges will help integrate AI seamlessly within sleep medicine and augment clinical practice.

Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool in healthcare that may improve patient care, enhance diagnostic abilities, and augment the management of sleep disorders. However, there is a need to regulate and standardize existing machine learning algorithms prior to its inclusion in the sleep clinic.

Title = Expediting knowledge acquisition by a web framework for Knowledge Graph Exploration and Visualization (KGEV): case studies on COVID-19 and Human Phenotype Ontology

Knowledges graphs (KGs) serve as a convenient framework for structuring knowledge. A number of computational methods have been developed to generate KGs from biomedical literature and use them for downstream tasks such as link prediction and question answering. However, there is a lack of computational tools or web frameworks to support the exploration and visualization of the KG themselves, which would facilitate interactive knowledge discovery and formulation of novel biological hypotheses.

We developed a web framework for Knowledge Graph Exploration and Visualization (KGEV), to construct and visualize KGs in five stages: triple extraction, triple filtration, metadata preparation, knowledge integration, and graph database preparation. The application has convenient user interface tools, such as node and edge search and filtering, data source filtering, neighborhood retrieval, and shortest path calculation, that work by querying a backend graph database. Unlike other KGs, our framework allows fast retrieval of relevant texts supporting the relationships in the KG, thus allowing human reviewers to judge the reliability of the knowledge extracted.

We demonstrated a case study of using the KGEV framework to perform research on COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an explosion of relevant literature, making it challenging to make full use of the vast and heterogenous sources of information. We generated a COVID-19 KG with heterogenous information, including literature information from the CORD-19 dataset, as well as other existing knowledge from eight data sources. We showed the utility of KGEV in three intuitive case studies to explore and query knowledge on COVID-19. A demo of this web application can be accessed at http://covid19nlp.wglab.org. Finally, we also demonstrated a turn-key adaption of the KGEV framework to study clinical phenotypic presentation of human diseases by Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), illustrating the versatility of the framework.

In an era of literature explosion, the KGEV framework can be applied to many emerging diseases to support structured navigation of the vast amount of newly published biomedical literature and other existing biological knowledge in various databases. It can be also used as a general-purpose tool to explore and query gene-phenotype-disease-drug relationships interactively.

Title = Trust me if you can: a survey on reliability and interpretability of machine learning approaches for drug sensitivity prediction in cancer

With the ever-increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, mitigating risks associated with their use has become one of the most urgent scientific and societal issues. To this end, the European Union passed the EU AI Act, proposing solution strategies that can be summarized under the umbrella term trustworthiness. In anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction, machine learning (ML) methods are developed for application in medical decision support systems, which require an extraordinary level of trustworthiness. This review offers an overview of the ML landscape of methods for anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction, including a brief introduction to the four major ML realms (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning). In particular, we address the question to what extent trustworthiness-related properties, more specifically, interpretability and reliability, have been incorporated into anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction methods over the previous decade. In total, we analyzed 36 papers with approaches for anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction. Our results indicate that the need for reliability has hardly been addressed so far. Interpretability, on the other hand, has often been considered for model development. However, the concept is rather used intuitively, lacking clear definitions. Thus, we propose an easily extensible taxonomy for interpretability, unifying all prevalent connotations explicitly or implicitly used within the field.
