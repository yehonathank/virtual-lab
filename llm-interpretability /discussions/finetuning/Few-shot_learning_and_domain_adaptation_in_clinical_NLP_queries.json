        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Computational Linguist to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.\n                You are responsible for understanding the topic Few-shot learning and domain adaptation in clinical NLP in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.\n                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Few-shot learning and domain adaptation in clinical NLP to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.\n                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Few-shot learning and domain adaptation in clinical NLP. Include both general queries about Few-shot learning and domain adaptation in clinical NLP and queries that specifically relate Few-shot learning and domain adaptation in clinical NLP to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.\n                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Few-shot learning and domain adaptation in clinical NLP (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?\n\nComputational Linguist, please provide your response to the agenda."

These queries are designed to cover both general aspects of Few-shot learning and domain adaptation, as well as their specific applications to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"Few-shot learning in clinical natural language processing\",\n    \"Domain adaptation techniques in clinical NLP\",\n    \"Few-shot learning and LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions\",\n    \"Domain adaptation for LLMs in clinical phenotype extraction\",\n    \"Building clinician trust through LLM interpretability in clinical applications\"\n]\n```\n\nThese queries are structured to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in these areas, helping to identify methodologies and insights that can be applied to the development of a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool."
