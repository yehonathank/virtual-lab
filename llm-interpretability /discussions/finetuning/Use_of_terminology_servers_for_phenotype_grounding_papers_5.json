        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Clinical Informatics Specialist to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.\n                You are responsible for understanding the topic Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.\n                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.\n                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding. Include both general queries about Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding and queries that specifically relate Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.\n                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the PMCIDs and titles of the papers you wish to fine-tune yourself on (as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as double-quoted string)?\n\nClinical Informatics Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "It seems that the specific queries I attempted did not return any results from PubMed Central. This might be due to the specificity of the search terms or the novelty of the research area. Here are the queries I used:\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"\\\"terminology servers\\\" AND \\\"phenotype grounding\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"terminology servers\\\" AND \\\"LLM interpretability\\\" AND \\\"phenotype definition\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"terminology servers\\\" AND \\\"clinical applications\\\" AND \\\"phenotype grounding\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"terminology servers\\\" AND \\\"clinician trust\\\" AND \\\"phenotype grounding\\\"\",\n    \"\\\"SNOMED CT\\\" AND \\\"phenotype grounding\\\" AND \\\"LLM interpretability\\\"\"\n]\n```\n\nGiven the lack of results, I recommend broadening the search terms or exploring related concepts that might yield more literature. Additionally, exploring other databases or sources might be beneficial. If you have any specific areas or alternative terms you would like to explore, please let me know!"
