The development of computable phenotype algorithms to solve these tasks is a challenging problem, caused by various reasons. Firstly, the term \u2018phenotype\u2019 has no generally agreed definition and its meaning depends on context. Secondly, the phenotypes are most commonly specified as non-computable descriptive documents. Recent attempts have shown that ontologies are a suitable way to handle phenotypes and that they can support clinical research and decision making.\n\nThe SMITH Consortium is dedicated to rapidly establish an integrative medical informatics framework to provide physicians with the best available data and knowledge and enable innovative use of healthcare data for research and treatment optimisation. In the context of a methodological use case \u2018phenotype pipeline\u2019 (PheP), a technology to automatically generate phenotype classifications and annotations based on electronic health records (EHR) is developed. A large series of phenotype algorithms will be implemented. This implies that for each algorithm a classification scheme and its input variables have to be defined. Furthermore, a phenotype engine is required to evaluate and execute developed algorithms.\n\nIn this article, we present a Core Ontology of Phenotypes (COP) and the software Phenotype Manager (PhenoMan), which implements a novel ontology-based method to model, classify and compute phenotypes from already available data. Our solution includes an enhanced iterative reasoning process combining classification tasks with mathematical calculations at runtime. The ontology as well as the reasoning method were successfully evaluated with selected phenotypes including SOFA score, socio-economic status, body surface area and WHO BMI classification based on available medical data.\n\nWe developed a novel ontology-based method to model phenotypes of living beings with the aim of automated phenotype reasoning based on available data. This new approach can be used in clinical context, e.g., for supporting the diagnostic process, evaluating risk factors, and recruiting appropriate participants for clinical and epidemiological studies.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 3303732\n\nTitle = Towards linked open gene mutations data\n\nWith the advent of high-throughput technologies, a great wealth of variation data is being produced. Such information may constitute the basis for correlation analyses between genotypes and phenotypes and, in the future, for personalized medicine. Several databases on gene variation exist, but this kind of information is still scarce in the Semantic Web framework.\n\nIn this paper, we discuss issues related to the integration of mutation data in the Linked Open Data infrastructure, part of the Semantic Web framework. We present the development of a mapping from the IARC TP53 Mutation database to RDF and the implementation of servers publishing this data.\n\nA version of the IARC TP53 Mutation database implemented in a relational database was used as first test set. Automatic mappings to RDF were first created by using D2RQ and later manually refined by introducing concepts and properties from domain vocabularies and ontologies, as well as links to Linked Open Data implementations of various systems of biomedical interest.\n\nSince D2RQ query performances are lower than those that can be achieved by using an RDF archive, generated data was also loaded into a dedicated system based on tools from the Jena software suite.\n\nWe have implemented a D2RQ Server for TP53 mutation data, providing data on a subset of the IARC database, including gene variations, somatic mutations, and bibliographic references. The server allows to browse the RDF graph by using links both between classes and to external systems. An alternative interface offers improved performances for SPARQL queries. The resulting data can be explored by using any Semantic Web browser or application.\n\nThis has been the first case of a mutation database exposed as Linked Data. A revised version of our prototype, including further concepts and IARC TP53 Mutation database data sets, is under development.\n\nThe publication of variation information as Linked Data opens new perspectives: the exploitation of SPARQL searches on mutation data and other biological databases may support data retrieval which is presently not possible. Moreover, reasoning on integrated variation data may support discoveries towards personalized medicine.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 10236701\n\nTitle = An analysis of entity normalization evaluation biases in specialized domains\n\nEntity normalization is an important information extraction task which has recently gained attention, particularly in the clinical/biomedical and life science domains. On several datasets, state-of-the-art methods perform rather well on popular benchmarks. Yet, we argue that the task is far from resolved.\n\nWe have selected two gold standard corpora and two state-of-the-art methods to highlight some evaluation biases. We present non-exhaustive initial findings on the existence of evaluation problems of the entity normalization task. \n\nOur analysis suggests better evaluation practices to support the methodological research in this field.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 7485218\n\nTitle = Named Entity Recognition and Relation Detection for Biomedical Information Extraction\n\nThe number of scientific publications in the literature is steadily growing, containing our knowledge in the biomedical, health, and clinical sciences. Since there is currently no automatic archiving of the obtained results, much of this information remains buried in textual details not readily available for further usage or analysis. For this reason, natural language processing (NLP) and text mining methods are used for information extraction from such publications. In this paper, we review practices for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Detection (RD), allowing, e.g., to identify interactions between proteins and drugs or genes and diseases. This information can be integrated into networks to summarize large-scale details on a particular biomedical or clinical problem, which is then amenable for easy data management and further analysis. Furthermore, we survey novel deep learning methods that have recently been introduced for such tasks.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 10013972\n\nTitle = First Organoid Intelligence (OI) workshop to form an OI community\n\nThe brain is arguably the most powerful computation system known. It is extremely efficient in processing large amounts of information and can discern signals from noise, adapt, and filter faulty information all while running on only 20 watts of power. The human brain's processing efficiency, progressive learning, and plasticity are unmatched by any computer system. Recent advances in stem cell technology have elevated the field of cell culture to higher levels of complexity, such as the development of three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids that recapitulate human brain functionality better than traditional monolayer cell systems. Organoid Intelligence (OI) aims to harness the innate biological capabilities of brain organoids for biocomputing and synthetic intelligence by interfacing them with computer technology. With the latest strides in stem cell technology, bioengineering, and machine learning, we can explore the ability of brain organoids to compute, and store given information (input), execute a task (output), and study how this affects the structural and functional connections in the organoids themselves. Furthermore, understanding how learning generates and changes patterns of connectivity in organoids can shed light on the early stages of cognition in the human brain. Investigating and understanding these concepts is an enormous, multidisciplinary endeavor that necessitates the engagement of both the scientific community and the public. Thus, on Feb 22\u201324 of 2022, the Johns Hopkins University held the first Organoid Intelligence Workshop to form an OI Community and to lay out the groundwork for the establishment of OI as a new scientific discipline. The potential of OI to revolutionize computing, neurological research, and drug development was discussed, along with a vision and roadmap for its development over the coming decade.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 1 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Terminology servers and LLM interpretability in phenotype definition\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11495871\n\nTitle = Digital approaches in post-COVID healthcare: a systematic review of technological innovations in disease management\n\nPost-COVID conditions (PCC) emerged during the pandemic, prompting a rise in the use of Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) to manage lockdowns and hospital overcrowding. Real-time tracking and information analyses were crucial to strengthening the global research response. This study aims to map the use of modern digital approaches in estimating the prevalence, predicting, diagnosing, treating, monitoring, and prognosis of PCC. This review was conducted by searching PubMed and Scopus databases for keywords and synonyms related to DHTs, Smart Healthcare Systems, and PCC based on the World Health Organization definition. Articles published from 1 January 2020 to 21 May 2024 were screened for eligibility based on predefined inclusion criteria, and the PRISMA framework was used to report the findings from the retained studies. Our search identified 377 studies, but we retained 23 studies that used DHTs, artificial intelligence (AI), and infodemiology to diagnose, estimate prevalence, predict, treat, and monitor PCC. Notably, a few interventions used infodemics to identify the clinical presentations of the disease, while most utilized Electronic Health Records and AI tools to estimate diagnosis and prevalence. However, we found that AI tools were scarcely used for monitoring symptoms, and studies involving SHS were non-existent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These findings show several DHTs used in healthcare, but there is an urgent need for further research in SHS for complex health conditions, particularly in LMICs. Enhancing DHTs and integrating AI and infodemiology provide promising avenues for managing epidemics and related complications, such as PCC.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Phenotype grounding using SNOMED CT in clinical applications\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 3579732\n\nTitle = Semantically enabling a genome-wide association study database\n\nThe amount of data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has grown rapidly, but considerations for GWAS phenotype data reuse and interchange have not kept pace. This impacts on the work of GWAS Central \u2013 a free and open access resource for the advanced querying and comparison of summary-level genetic association data. The benefits of employing ontologies for standardising and structuring data are widely accepted. The complex spectrum of observed human phenotypes (and traits), and the requirement for cross-species phenotype comparisons, calls for reflection on the most appropriate solution for the organisation of human phenotype data. The Semantic Web provides standards for the possibility of further integration of GWAS data and the ability to contribute to the web of Linked Data.\n\nA pragmatic consideration when applying phenotype ontologies to GWAS data is the ability to retrieve all data, at the most granular level possible, from querying a single ontology graph. We found the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terminology suitable for describing all traits (diseases and medical signs and symptoms) at various levels of granularity and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) most suitable for describing phenotypic abnormalities (medical signs and symptoms) at the most granular level. Diseases within MeSH are mapped to HPO to infer the phenotypic abnormalities associated with diseases. Building on the rich semantic phenotype annotation layer, we are able to make cross-species phenotype comparisons and publish a core subset of GWAS data as RDF nanopublications.\n\nWe present a methodology for applying phenotype annotations to a comprehensive genome-wide association dataset and for ensuring compatibility with the Semantic Web. The annotations are used to assist with cross-species genotype and phenotype comparisons. However, further processing and deconstructions of terms may be required to facilitate automatic phenotype comparisons. The provision of GWAS nanopublications enables a new dimension for exploring GWAS data, by way of intrinsic links to related data resources within the Linked Data web. The value of such annotation and integration will grow as more biomedical resources adopt the standards of the Semantic Web.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 3957334\n\nTitle = Semantically enabling pharmacogenomic data for the realization of personalized medicine\n\nUnderstanding how each individual\u2019s genetics and physiology influences pharmaceutical response is crucial to the realization of personalized medicine and the discovery and validation of pharmacogenomic biomarkers is key to its success. However, integration of genotype and phenotype knowledge in medical information systems remains a critical challenge. The inability to easily and accurately integrate the results of biomolecular studies with patients\u2019 medical records and clinical reports prevents us from realizing the full potential of pharmacogenomic knowledge for both drug development and clinical practice. Herein, we describe approaches using Semantic Web technologies, in which pharmacogenomic knowledge relevant to drug development and medical decision support is represented in such a way that it can be efficiently accessed both by software and human experts. We suggest that this approach increases the utility of data, and that such computational technologies will become an essential part of personalized medicine, alongside diagnostics and pharmaceutical products.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 3338382\n\nTitle = The Bone Dysplasia Ontology: integrating genotype and phenotype information in the skeletal dysplasia domain\n\nSkeletal dysplasias are a rare and heterogeneous group of genetic disorders affecting skeletal development. Patients with skeletal dysplasias suffer from many complex medical issues including degenerative joint disease and neurological complications. Because the data and expertise associated with this field is both sparse and disparate, significant benefits will potentially accrue from the availability of an ontology that provides a shared conceptualisation of the domain knowledge and enables data integration, cross-referencing and advanced reasoning across the relevant but distributed data sources.\n\nWe introduce the design considerations and implementation details of the Bone Dysplasia Ontology. We also describe the different components of the ontology, including a comprehensive and formal representation of the skeletal dysplasia domain as well as the related genotypes and phenotypes. We then briefly describe SKELETOME, a community-driven knowledge curation platform that is underpinned by the Bone Dysplasia Ontology. SKELETOME enables domain experts to use, refine and extend and apply the ontology without any prior ontology engineering experience--to advance the body of knowledge in the skeletal dysplasia field.\n\nThe Bone Dysplasia Ontology represents the most comprehensive structured knowledge source for the skeletal dysplasias domain. It provides the means for integrating and annotating clinical and research data, not only at the generic domain knowledge level, but also at the level of individual patient case studies. It enables links between individual cases and publicly available genotype and phenotype resources based on a community-driven curation process that ensures a shared conceptualisation of the domain knowledge and its continuous incremental evolution.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 10460697\n\nTitle = Development of a Systems Medicine Approach to Spinal Cord Injury\n\nTraumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) causes a sudden onset multi-system disease, permanently altering homeostasis with multiple complications. Consequences include aberrant neuronal circuits, multiple organ system dysfunctions, and chronic phenotypes such as neuropathic pain and metabolic syndrome. Reductionist approaches are used to classify SCI patients based on residual neurological function. Still, recovery varies due to interacting variables, including individual biology, comorbidities, complications, therapeutic side effects, and socioeconomic influences for which data integration methods are lacking. Infections, pressure sores, and heterotopic ossification are known recovery modifiers. However, the molecular pathobiology of the disease-modifying factors altering the neurological recovery-chronic syndrome trajectory is mainly unknown, with significant data gaps between intensive early treatment and chronic phases. Changes in organ function such as gut dysbiosis, adrenal dysregulation, fatty liver, muscle loss, and autonomic dysregulation disrupt homeostasis, generating progression-driving allostatic load. Interactions between interdependent systems produce emergent effects, such as resilience, that preclude single mechanism interpretations. Due to many interacting variables in individuals, substantiating the effects of treatments to improve neurological outcomes is difficult. Acute injury outcome predictors, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging signal changes, and autonomic system abnormalities, often do not predict chronic SCI syndrome phenotypes. In systems medicine, network analysis of bioinformatics data is used to derive molecular control modules. To better understand the evolution from acute SCI to chronic SCI multi-system states, we propose a topological phenotype framework integrating bioinformatics, physiological data, and allostatic load tested against accepted established recovery metrics. This form of correlational phenotyping may reveal critical nodal points for intervention to improve recovery trajectories. This study examines the limitations of current classifications of SCI and how these can evolve through systems medicine.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 2837642\n\nTitle = Biomedical informatics and translational medicine\n\nBiomedical informatics involves a core set of methodologies that can provide a foundation for crossing the \"translational barriers\" associated with translational medicine. To this end, the fundamental aspects of biomedical informatics (e.g., bioinformatics, imaging informatics, clinical informatics, and public health informatics) may be essential in helping improve the ability to bring basic research findings to the bedside, evaluate the efficacy of interventions across communities, and enable the assessment of the eventual impact of translational medicine innovations on health policies. Here, a brief description is provided for a selection of key biomedical informatics topics (Decision Support, Natural Language Processing, Standards, Information Retrieval, and Electronic Health Records) and their relevance to translational medicine. Based on contributions and advancements in each of these topic areas, the article proposes that biomedical informatics practitioners (\"biomedical informaticians\") can be essential members of translational medicine teams.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 3 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Building clinician trust through visual interpretability tools in phenotype definitions\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11299037\n\nTitle = Trust me if you can: a survey on reliability and interpretability of machine learning approaches for drug sensitivity prediction in cancer\n\nWith the ever-increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, mitigating risks associated with their use has become one of the most urgent scientific and societal issues. To this end, the European Union passed the EU AI Act, proposing solution strategies that can be summarized under the umbrella term trustworthiness. In anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction, machine learning (ML) methods are developed for application in medical decision support systems, which require an extraordinary level of trustworthiness. This review offers an overview of the ML landscape of methods for anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction, including a brief introduction to the four major ML realms (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning). In particular, we address the question to what extent trustworthiness-related properties, more specifically, interpretability and reliability, have been incorporated into anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction methods over the previous decade. In total, we analyzed 36 papers with approaches for anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction. Our results indicate that the need for reliability has hardly been addressed so far. Interpretability, on the other hand, has often been considered for model development. However, the concept is rather used intuitively, lacking clear definitions. Thus, we propose an easily extensible taxonomy for interpretability, unifying all prevalent connotations explicitly or implicitly used within the field.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 7705438\n\nTitle = Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters\n\n\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 9429973\n\nTitle = Abstract Book for the 27th Congress of the European Hematology Association\n\n\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Machine learning and terminology servers for electronic phenotype definitions\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 7820849\n\nTitle = Machine learning approaches and databases for prediction of drug\u2013target interaction: a survey paper\n\nThe task of predicting the interactions between drugs and targets plays a key role in the process of drug discovery. There is a need to develop novel and efficient prediction approaches in order to avoid costly and laborious yet not-always-deterministic experiments to determine drug\u2013target interactions (DTIs) by experiments alone. These approaches should be capable of identifying the potential DTIs in a timely manner. In this article, we describe the data required for the task of DTI prediction followed by a comprehensive catalog consisting of machine learning methods and databases, which have been proposed and utilized to predict DTIs. The advantages and disadvantages of each set of methods are also briefly discussed. Lastly, the challenges one may face in prediction of DTI using machine learning approaches are highlighted and we conclude by shedding some lights on important future research directions.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 7350392\n\nTitle = Guidelines for the use of flow cytometry and cell sorting in immunological studies (second edition)\n\nThese guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community.

Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed.

Prediction of high risk can allow for early delivery of existing interventions for prevention. This ongoing study aims to use digital phenotyping data from the Mom2B smartphone application to develop models to predict women at high risk for mental and somatic complications.\n\nAll Swedish-speaking women over 18 years, who are either pregnant or within 3 months postpartum are eligible to participate by downloading the Mom2B smartphone app. We aim to recruit at least 5000 participants with completed outcome measures. Throughout the pregnancy and within the first year postpartum, both active and passive data are collected via the app in an effort to establish a participant\u2019s digital phenotype. Active data collection consists of surveys related to participant background information, mental and physical health, lifestyle, and social circumstances, as well as voice recordings. Participants\u2019 general smartphone activity, geographical movement patterns, social media activity and cognitive patterns can be estimated through passive data collection from smartphone sensors and activity logs. The outcomes will be measured using surveys, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and through linkage to national registers, from where information on registered clinical diagnoses and received care, including prescribed medication, can be obtained. Advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques will be applied to these multimodal data in order to develop accurate algorithms for the prediction of perinatal depression and preterm birth. In this way, earlier intervention may be possible.\n\nEthical approval has been obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (dnr: 2019/01170, with amendments), and the project fully fulfils the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements.

These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems\u2014patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients\u2014and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 11472501\n\nTitle = State-of-the-Art Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)\u2013Based Data Model and Structure Implementations: Systematic Scoping Review\n\nData models are crucial for clinical research as they enable researchers to fully use the vast amount of clinical data stored in medical systems. Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data availability for research.\n\nThis research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned in the selected research papers.\n\nTo ensure the extraction of reliable results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different studies.\n\nOn the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage and security. The most common resource was \u201cObservation\u201d followed by \u201cCondition\u201d and \u201cPatient.\u201d The limitations and challenges of developing data models were categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability.\n\nFHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for systems and data warehouses across different settings. However, ongoing efforts to address existing limitations and challenges are essential for the successful implementation and integration of FHIR data models.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n"
