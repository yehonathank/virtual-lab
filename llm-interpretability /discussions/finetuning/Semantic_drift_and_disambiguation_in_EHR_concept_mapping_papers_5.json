However, patient privacy has become a major concern that limits data sharing across hospital settings and subsequently hinders the advances in AI. Synthetic data, which benefits from the development and proliferation of generative models, has served as a promising substitute for real patient EHR data. However, the current generative models are limited as they only generate single type of clinical data for a synthetic patient, i.e., either continuous-valued or discrete-valued. To mimic the nature of clinical decision-making which encompasses various data types/sources, in this study, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) entitled EHR-M-GAN that simultaneously synthesizes mixed-type timeseries EHR data. EHR-M-GAN is capable of capturing the multidimensional, heterogeneous, and correlated temporal dynamics in patient trajectories. We have validated EHR-M-GAN on three publicly-available intensive care unit databases with records from a total of 141,488 unique patients, and performed privacy risk evaluation of the proposed model. EHR-M-GAN has demonstrated its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks for synthesizing clinical timeseries with high fidelity, while addressing the limitations regarding data types and dimensionality in the current generative models. Notably, prediction models for outcomes of intensive care performed significantly better when training data was augmented with the addition of EHR-M-GAN-generated timeseries. EHR-M-GAN may have use in developing AI algorithms in resource-limited settings, lowering the barrier for data acquisition while preserving patient privacy.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11074891\n\nTitle = Generating Synthetic Electronic Health Record Data Using Generative Adversarial Networks: Tutorial\n\nSynthetic electronic health record (EHR) data generation has been increasingly recognized as an important solution to expand the accessibility and maximize the value of private health data on a large scale. Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated more accurate modeling for complex and high-dimensional data, thereby greatly enhancing the data quality of synthetic EHR data. Among various approaches, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become the main technical path in the literature due to their ability to capture the statistical characteristics of real data. However, there is a scarcity of detailed guidance within the domain regarding the development procedures of synthetic EHR data. The objective of this tutorial is to present a transparent and reproducible process for generating structured synthetic EHR data using a publicly accessible EHR data set as an example. We cover the topics of GAN architecture, EHR data types and representation, data preprocessing, GAN training, synthetic data generation and postprocessing, and data quality evaluation. We conclude this tutorial by discussing multiple important issues and future opportunities in this domain. The source code of the entire process has been made publicly available.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 2 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Disambiguation in electronic health records\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11467596\n\nTitle = Processing of Short-Form Content in Clinical Narratives: Systematic Scoping Review\n\nClinical narratives are essential components of electronic health records. The adoption of electronic health records has increased documentation time for hospital staff, leading to the use of abbreviations and acronyms more frequently. This brevity can potentially hinder comprehension for both professionals and patients.\n\nThis review aims to provide an overview of the types of short forms found in clinical narratives, as well as the natural language processing (NLP) techniques used for their identification, expansion, and disambiguation.\n\nIn the databases Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, EBMR (Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews), and ACL Anthology, publications that met the inclusion criteria were searched according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for a systematic scoping review. Original, peer-reviewed publications focusing on short-form processing in human clinical narratives were included, covering the period from January 2018 to February 2023. Short-form types were extracted, and multidimensional research methodologies were assigned to each target objective (identification, expansion, and disambiguation). NLP study recommendations and study characteristics were systematically assigned occurrence rates for evaluation.\n\nOut of a total of 6639 records, only 19 articles were included in the final analysis. Rule-based approaches were predominantly used for identifying short forms, while string similarity and vector representations were applied for expansion. Embeddings and deep learning approaches were used for disambiguation.\n\nThe scope and types of what constitutes a clinical short form were often not explicitly defined by the authors. This lack of definition poses challenges for reproducibility and for determining whether specific methodologies are suitable for different types of short forms. Analysis of a subset of NLP recommendations for assessing quality and reproducibility revealed only partial adherence to these recommendations. Single-character abbreviations were underrepresented in studies on clinical narrative processing, as were investigations in languages other than English. Future research should focus on these 2 areas, and each paper should include descriptions of the types of content analyzed.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 8449626\n\nTitle = Automated detection of substance use information from electronic health records for a pediatric population\n\nSubstance use screening in adolescence is unstandardized and often documented in clinical notes, rather than in structured electronic health records (EHRs). The objective of this study was to integrate logic rules with state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies to detect substance use information from both structured and unstructured EHR data.\n\nPediatric patients (10-20 years of age) with any encounter between July 1, 2012, and October 31, 2017, were included (n = 3890 patients; 19 478 encounters). EHR data were extracted at each encounter, manually reviewed for substance use (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, opiate, any use), and coded as lifetime use, current use, or family use. Logic rules mapped structured EHR indicators to screening results. A knowledge-based NLP system and a deep learning model detected substance use information from unstructured clinical narratives. System performance was evaluated using positive predictive value, sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n\nThe dataset included 17 235 structured indicators and 27 141 clinical narratives. Manual review of clinical narratives captured 94.0% of positive screening results, while structured EHR data captured 22.0%. Logic rules detected screening results from structured data with 1.0 and 0.99 for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The knowledge-based system detected substance use information from clinical narratives with 0.86, 0.79, and 0.88 for AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. The deep learning model further improved detection capacity, achieving 0.88, 0.81, and 0.85 for AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. Finally, integrating predictions from structured and unstructured data achieved high detection capacity across all cases (0.96, 0.85, and 0.87 for AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively).\n\nIt is feasible to detect substance use screening and results among pediatric patients using logic rules, NLP, and machine learning technologies.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 2 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Semantic drift and LLM interpretability in phenotype definition\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11925797\n\nTitle = Computational tools and data integration to accelerate vaccine development: challenges, opportunities, and future directions\n\nThe development of effective vaccines is crucial for combating current and emerging pathogens. Despite significant advances in the field of vaccine development there remain numerous challenges including the lack of standardized data reporting and curation practices, making it difficult to determine correlates of protection from experimental and clinical studies. Significant gaps in data and knowledge integration can hinder vaccine development which relies on a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the host immune system. In this review, we explore the current landscape of vaccine development, highlighting the computational challenges, limitations, and opportunities associated with integrating diverse data types for leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in vaccine design. We discuss the role of natural language processing, semantic integration, and causal inference in extracting valuable insights from published literature and unstructured data sources, as well as the computational modeling of immune responses. Furthermore, we highlight specific challenges associated with uncertainty quantification in vaccine development and emphasize the importance of establishing standardized data formats and ontologies to facilitate the integration and analysis of heterogeneous data. Through data harmonization and integration, the development of safe and effective vaccines can be accelerated to improve public health outcomes. Looking to the future, we highlight the need for collaborative efforts among researchers, data scientists, and public health experts to realize the full potential of AI-assisted vaccine design and streamline the vaccine development process.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11076269\n\nTitle = A mini-review on perturbation modelling across single-cell omic modalities\n\nRecent advances in single-cell omics technology have transformed the landscape of cellular and molecular research, enriching the scope and intricacy of cellular characterisation. Perturbation modelling seeks to comprehensively grasp the effects of external influences like disease onset or molecular knock-outs or external stimulants on cellular physiology, specifically on transcription factors, signal transducers, biological pathways, and dynamic cell states. Machine and deep learning tools transform complex perturbational phenomena in algorithmically tractable tasks to formulate predictions based on various types of single-cell datasets. However, the recent surge in tools and datasets makes it challenging for experimental biologists and computational scientists to keep track of the recent advances in this rapidly expanding filed of single-cell modelling. Here, we recapitulate the main objectives of perturbation modelling and summarise novel single-cell perturbation technologies based on genetic manipulation like CRISPR or compounds, spanning across omic modalities. We then concisely review a burgeoning group of computational methods extending from classical statistical inference methodologies to various machine and deep learning architectures like shallow models or autoencoders, to biologically informed approaches based on gene regulatory networks, and to combinatorial efforts reminiscent of ensemble learning. We also discuss the rising trend of large foundational models in single-cell perturbation modelling inspired by large language models. Lastly, we critically assess the challenges that underline single-cell perturbation modelling while pointing towards relevant future perspectives like perturbation atlases, multi-omics and spatial datasets, causal machine learning for interpretability, multi-task learning for performance and explainability as well as prospects for solving interoperability and benchmarking pitfalls.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 2 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"EHR concept mapping and clinical applications\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11798655\n\nTitle = Interventions to Mitigate EHR and Documentation Burden in Health Professions Trainees: A Scoping Review\n\nBackground \u2003Health professions trainees (trainees) are unique as they learn a chosen field while working within electronic health records (EHRs). Efforts to mitigate EHR burden have been described for the experienced health professional (HP), but less is understood for trainees. EHR or documentation burden ( EHR burden ) affects trainees, although not all trainees use EHRs, and use may differ for experienced HPs. \n\nObjectives \u2003This study aimed to develop a model of how interventions to mitigate EHR burden fit within the trainee EHR workflow: the Trainee EHR Burden Model . (We: 1) Examined trainee experiences of interventions aimed at mitigating EHR burden (scoping review) and (2) Adapted an existing workflow model by mapping included studies (concept clarification). \n\nMethods \u2003We conducted a four-database scoping review applying Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extensions for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidance, examining scholarly, peer-reviewed studies that measured trainee experience of interventions to mitigate EHR burden. We conducted a concept clarification categorizing, then mapping studies to workflow model elements. We adapted the model to intervenable points for trainee EHR burden. \n\nResults \u2003We identified 11 studies examining interventions to mitigate EHR burden that measured trainee experience. Interventions included curriculum, training, and coaching on the existing EHR for both simulated or live tasks; evaluating scribes' impact; adding devices or technology tailored to rounds; and team communication or data presentation at end-of-shift handoffs. Interventions had varying effects on EHR burden, most commonly measured through surveys, and less commonly, direct observation. Most studies had limited sample sizes and focused on inpatient settings and physician trainees. \n\nConclusion \u2003Few studies measured trainee perspectives of interventions aiming to mitigate EHR burden. Many studies applied quasi-experimental designs and focused on inpatient settings. The Trainee EHR Burden Model , adapted from an existing workflow model, offers a starting place to situate points of intervention in trainee workflow. Further research is needed to design new interventions targeting stages of HP trainee workflow, in a range of clinical settings. \n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11561445\n\nTitle = Question Answering for Electronic Health Records: Scoping Review of Datasets and Models\n\nQuestion answering (QA) systems for patient-related data can assist both clinicians and patients. They can, for example, assist clinicians in decision-making and enable patients to have a better understanding of their medical history. Substantial amounts of patient data are stored in electronic health records (EHRs), making EHR QA an important research area. Because of the differences in data format and modality, this differs greatly from other medical QA tasks that use medical websites or scientific papers to retrieve answers, making it critical to research EHR QA.\n\nThis study aims to provide a methodological review of existing works on QA for EHRs. The objectives of this study were to identify the existing EHR QA datasets and analyze them, study the state-of-the-art methodologies used in this task, compare the different evaluation metrics used by these state-of-the-art models, and finally elicit the various challenges and the ongoing issues in EHR QA.\n\nWe searched for articles from January 1, 2005, to September 30, 2023, in 4 digital sources, including Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed, to collect relevant publications on EHR QA. Our systematic screening process followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A total of 4111 papers were identified for our study, and after screening based on our inclusion criteria, we obtained 47 papers for further study. The selected studies were then classified into 2 non\u2013mutually exclusive categories depending on their scope: \u201cEHR QA datasets\u201d and \u201cEHR QA models.\u201d\n\nA systematic screening process obtained 47 papers on EHR QA for final review. Out of the 47 papers, 53% (n=25) were about EHR QA datasets, and 79% (n=37) papers were about EHR QA models. It was observed that QA on EHRs is relatively new and unexplored. Most of the works are fairly recent. In addition, it was observed that emrQA is by far the most popular EHR QA dataset, both in terms of citations and usage in other papers. We have classified the EHR QA datasets based on their modality, and we have inferred that Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and the National Natural Language Processing Clinical Challenges datasets (ie, n2c2 datasets) are the most popular EHR databases and corpuses used in EHR QA. Furthermore, we identified the different models used in EHR QA along with the evaluation metrics used for these models.\n\nEHR QA research faces multiple challenges, such as the limited availability of clinical annotations, concept normalization in EHR QA, and challenges faced in generating realistic EHR QA datasets. There are still many gaps in research that motivate further work. This study will assist future researchers in focusing on areas of EHR QA that have possible future research directions.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 1 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Building clinician trust in LLM-based phenotype tools\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 10834163\n\nTitle = Artificial intelligence: revolutionizing cardiology with large language models\n\nOverview of input sources (top) to train or fine-tune cardio large language models and different applications (bottom).
