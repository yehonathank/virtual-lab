The review focuses on the medical field, as the medical ML application literature highlights a special necessity of medical experts collaborating with ML approaches. Methods: A scoping literature review is performed on Scopus and Google Scholar using the terms \u201chuman in the loop\u201d, \u201chuman in the loop machine learning\u201d, and \u201cinteractive machine learning\u201d. Peer-reviewed papers published from 2015 to 2020 are included in our review. Results: We design four questions to investigate and describe human\u2013AI interaction in ML applications. These questions are \u201cWhy should humans be in the loop?\u201d, \u201cWhere does human\u2013AI interaction occur in the ML processes?\u201d, \u201cWho are the humans in the loop?\u201d, and \u201cHow do humans interact with ML in Human-In-the-Loop ML (HILML)?\u201d. To answer the first question, we describe three main reasons regarding the importance of human involvement in ML applications. To address the second question, human\u2013AI interaction is investigated in three main algorithmic stages: 1. data producing and pre-processing; 2. ML modelling; and 3. ML evaluation and refinement. The importance of the expertise level of the humans in human\u2013AI interaction is described to answer the third question. The number of human interactions in HILML is grouped into three categories to address the fourth question. We conclude the paper by offering a discussion on open opportunities for future research in HILML.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 10570436\n\nTitle = Defining human-AI teaming the human-centered way: a scoping review and network analysis\n\nWith the advancement of technology and the increasing utilization of AI, the nature of human work is evolving, requiring individuals to collaborate not only with other humans but also with AI technologies to accomplish complex goals. This requires a shift in perspective from technology-driven questions to a human-centered research and design agenda putting people and evolving teams in the center of attention. A socio-technical approach is needed to view AI as more than just a technological tool, but as a team member, leading to the emergence of human-AI teaming (HAIT). In this new form of work, humans and AI synergistically combine their respective capabilities to accomplish shared goals.\n\nThe aim of our work is to uncover current research streams on HAIT and derive a unified understanding of the construct through a bibliometric network analysis, a scoping review and synthetization of a definition from a socio-technical point of view. In addition, antecedents and outcomes examined in the literature are extracted to guide future research in this field.\n\nThrough network analysis, five clusters with different research focuses on HAIT were identified. These clusters revolve around (1) human and (2) task-dependent variables, (3) AI explainability, (4) AI-driven robotic systems, and (5) the effects of AI performance on human perception. Despite these diverse research focuses, the current body of literature is predominantly driven by a technology-centric and engineering perspective, with no consistent definition or terminology of HAIT emerging to date.\n\nWe propose a unifying definition combining a human-centered and team-oriented perspective as well as summarize what is still needed in future research regarding HAIT. Thus, this work contributes to support the idea of the Frontiers Research Topic of a theoretical and conceptual basis for human work with AI systems.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 11525002\n\nTitle = Human-centered evaluation of explainable AI applications: a systematic review\n\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to provide insights into the inner workings and the outputs of AI systems. Recently, there's been growing recognition that explainability is inherently human-centric, tied to how people perceive explanations. Despite this, there is no consensus in the research community on whether user evaluation is crucial in XAI, and if so, what exactly needs to be evaluated and how. This systematic literature review addresses this gap by providing a detailed overview of the current state of affairs in human-centered XAI evaluation. We reviewed 73 papers across various domains where XAI was evaluated with users. These studies assessed what makes an explanation \u201cgood\u201d from a user's perspective, i.e., what makes an explanation meaningful to a user of an AI system. We identified 30 components of meaningful explanations that were evaluated in the reviewed papers and categorized them into a taxonomy of human-centered XAI evaluation, based on: (a) the contextualized quality of the explanation, (b) the contribution of the explanation to human-AI interaction, and (c) the contribution of the explanation to human-AI performance. Our analysis also revealed a lack of standardization in the methodologies applied in XAI user studies, with only 19 of the 73 papers applying an evaluation framework used by at least one other study in the sample. These inconsistencies hinder cross-study comparisons and broader insights. Our findings contribute to understanding what makes explanations meaningful to users and how to measure this, guiding the XAI community toward a more unified approach in human-centered explainability.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 11008604\n\nTitle = Ascribing consciousness to artificial intelligence: human-AI interaction and its carry-over effects on human-human interaction\n\nThe question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) can be considered conscious and therefore should be evaluated through a moral lens has surfaced in recent years. In this paper, we argue that whether AI is conscious is less of a concern than the fact that AI can be considered conscious by users during human-AI interaction, because this ascription of consciousness can lead to carry-over effects on human-human interaction. When AI is viewed as conscious like a human, then how people treat AI appears to carry over into how they treat other people due to activating schemas that are congruent to those activated during interactions with humans. In light of this potential, we might consider regulating how we treat AI, or how we build AI to evoke certain kinds of treatment from users, but not because AI is inherently sentient. This argument focuses on humanlike, social actor AI such as chatbots, digital voice assistants, and social robots. In the first part of the paper, we provide evidence for carry-over effects between perceptions of AI consciousness and behavior toward humans through literature on human-computer interaction, human-AI interaction, and the psychology of artificial agents. In the second part of the paper, we detail how the mechanism of schema activation can allow us to test consciousness perception as a driver of carry-over effects between human-AI interaction and human-human interaction. In essence, perceiving AI as conscious like a human, thereby activating congruent mind schemas during interaction, is a driver for behaviors and perceptions of AI that can carry over into how we treat humans. Therefore, the fact that people can ascribe humanlike consciousness to AI is worth considering, and moral protection for AI is also worth considering, regardless of AI\u2019s inherent conscious or moral status.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 11586345\n\nTitle = Managing human-AI collaborations within Industry 5.0 scenarios via knowledge graphs: key challenges and lessons learned\n\nIn this paper, we discuss technologies and approaches based on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) that enable the management of inline human interventions in AI-assisted manufacturing processes in Industry 5.0 under potentially changing conditions in order to maintain or improve the overall system performance. Whereas KG-based systems are commonly based on a static view with their structure fixed at design time, we argue that the dynamic challenge of inline Human-AI (H-AI) collaboration in industrial settings calls for a late shaping design principle. In contrast to early shaping, which determines the system's behavior at design time in a fine granular manner, late shaping is a coarse-to-fine approach that leaves more space for fine-tuning, adaptation and integration of human intelligence at runtime. In this context we discuss approaches and lessons learned from the European manufacturing project Teaming.AI, https://www.teamingai-project.eu/, addressing general challenges like the modeling of domain expertise with particular focus on vertical knowledge integration, as well as challenges linked to an industrial KG of choice, such as its dynamic population and the late shaping of KG embeddings as the foundation of relational machine learning models which have emerged as an effective tool for exploiting graph-structured data to infer new insights.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"LLM interpretability visual explanation tools\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11739813\n\nTitle = A review of large language models and autonomous agents in chemistry\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in chemistry, significantly impacting molecule design, property prediction, and synthesis optimization.

As agents are an emerging topic, we extend the scope of our review of agents beyond chemistry and discuss across any scientific domains. This review covers the recent history, current capabilities, and design of LLMs and autonomous agents, addressing specific challenges, opportunities, and future directions in chemistry. Key challenges include data quality and integration, model interpretability, and the need for standard benchmarks, while future directions point towards more sophisticated multi-modal agents and enhanced collaboration between agents and experimental methods.

However, conventional spike sorting methods are highly fragmented, labor-intensive, and heavily reliant on expert manual curation, limiting their scalability and reproducibility. This challenge has become more pressing with advances in neural recording technology, such as high-density Neuropixels for large-scale neural recording or flexible electrodes for long-term stable recording over months to years. The volume and complexity of these datasets make manual curation infeasible, requiring an automated and scalable solution. Here, we introduce SpikeAgent, a multimodal large language model (LLM)-based AI agent that automates and standardizes the entire spike sorting pipeline. Unlike traditional approaches, SpikeAgent integrates multiple LLM backends, coding functions, and established algorithms, autonomously performing spike sorting with reasoning-based decision-making and real-time interaction with intermediate results. It generates interpretable reports, providing transparent justifications for each sorting decision, enhancing transparency and reliability. We benchmarked SpikeAgent against human experts across various neural recording technology, demonstrating its versatility and ability to achieve curation consistency that are equal to, or even higher than human experts. It also drastically reduces the expertise barrier and accelerates the curation and validation time by orders of magnitude. Moreover, it enables automated interpretability of the neural spiking data, which cannot be achieved by any conventional methods. SpikeAgent presents a paradigm shift in processing signals for neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces, while laying the ground for AI agent-augmented science across various domains.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 10561547\n\nTitle = 14 examples of how LLMs can transform materials science and chemistry: a reflection on a large language model hackathon\u2020\n\nLarge-language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 caught the interest of many scientists. Recent studies suggested that these models could be useful in chemistry and materials science. To explore these possibilities, we organized a hackathon. This article chronicles the projects built as part of this hackathon. Participants employed LLMs for various applications, including predicting properties of molecules and materials, designing novel interfaces for tools, extracting knowledge from unstructured data, and developing new educational applications. The diverse topics and the fact that working prototypes could be generated in less than two days highlight that LLMs will profoundly impact the future of our fields. The rich collection of ideas and projects also indicates that the applications of LLMs are not limited to materials science and chemistry but offer potential benefits to a wide range of scientific disciplines.\n\nWe report the findings of a hackathon focused on exploring the diverse applications of large language models in molecular and materials science.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 11464944\n\nTitle = Multimodal Large Language Models in Health Care: Applications, Challenges, and Future Outlook\n\nIn the complex and multidimensional field of medicine, multimodal data are prevalent and crucial for informed clinical decisions. Multimodal data span a broad spectrum of data types, including medical images (eg, MRI and CT scans), time-series data (eg, sensor data from wearable devices and electronic health records), audio recordings (eg, heart and respiratory sounds and patient interviews), text (eg, clinical notes and research articles), videos (eg, surgical procedures), and omics data (eg, genomics and proteomics). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new applications for knowledge retrieval and processing in the medical field, most LLMs remain limited to processing unimodal data, typically text-based content, and often overlook the importance of integrating the diverse data modalities encountered in clinical practice. This paper aims to present a detailed, practical, and solution-oriented perspective on the use of multimodal LLMs (M-LLMs) in the medical field. Our investigation spanned M-LLM foundational principles, current and potential applications, technical and ethical challenges, and future research directions. By connecting these elements, we aimed to provide a comprehensive framework that links diverse aspects of M-LLMs, offering a unified vision for their future in health care. This approach aims to guide both future research and practical implementations of M-LLMs in health care, positioning them as a paradigm shift toward integrated, multimodal data\u2013driven medical practice. We anticipate that this work will spark further discussion and inspire the development of innovative approaches in the next generation of medical M-LLM systems.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 10898121\n\nTitle = Challenges and barriers of using large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT for diagnostic medicine with a focus on digital pathology \u2013 a recent scoping review\n\nThe integration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in diagnostic medicine, with a focus on digital pathology, has garnered significant attention. However, understanding the challenges and barriers associated with the use of LLMs in this context is crucial for their successful implementation.\n\nA scoping review was conducted to explore the challenges and barriers of using LLMs, in diagnostic medicine with a focus on digital pathology. A comprehensive search was conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, for relevant articles published within the past four years. The selected articles were critically analyzed to identify and summarize the challenges and barriers reported in the literature.\n\nThe scoping review identified several challenges and barriers associated with the use of LLMs in diagnostic medicine. These included limitations in contextual understanding and interpretability, biases in training data, ethical considerations, impact on healthcare professionals, and regulatory concerns. Contextual understanding and interpretability challenges arise due to the lack of true understanding of medical concepts and lack of these models being explicitly trained on medical records selected by trained professionals, and the black-box nature of LLMs. Biases in training data pose a risk of perpetuating disparities and inaccuracies in diagnoses. Ethical considerations include patient privacy, data security, and responsible AI use. The integration of LLMs may impact healthcare professionals\u2019 autonomy and decision-making abilities. Regulatory concerns surround the need for guidelines and frameworks to ensure safe and ethical implementation.\n\nThe scoping review highlights the challenges and barriers of using LLMs in diagnostic medicine with a focus on digital pathology. Understanding these challenges is essential for addressing the limitations and developing strategies to overcome barriers. It is critical for health professionals to be involved in the selection of data and fine tuning of the models. Further research, validation, and collaboration between AI developers, healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies are necessary to ensure the responsible and effective integration of LLMs in diagnostic medicine.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Electronic phenotype definition visual explanation\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 9617215\n\nTitle = Open Hardware in Science: The Benefits of Open Electronics\n\nOpenly shared low-cost electronic hardware applications, known as open electronics, have sparked a new open-source movement, with much untapped potential to advance scientific research.

Rods, active under dim illumination, are thought to saturate at higher (photopic) irradiances. The extent of rod saturation is not well defined; some studies report rod activity well into the photopic range. Using electrophysiological recordings from retina and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of cone-deficient and visually intact mice, we describe stimulus and physiological factors that influence photopic rod-driven responses. We find that rod contrast sensitivity is initially strongly reduced at high irradiances, but progressively recovers to allow responses to moderate contrast stimuli. Surprisingly, rods recover faster at higher light levels. A model of rod phototransduction suggests that phototransduction gain adjustments and bleaching adaptation underlie rod recovery. Consistently, exogenous chromophore reduces rod responses at bright background. Thus, bleaching adaptation renders mouse rods responsive to modest contrast at any irradiance. Paradoxically, raising irradiance across the photopic range increases the robustness of rod responses.\n\nRod photoreceptors are thought to be saturated under bright light. Here, the authors describe the physiological parameters that mediate response saturation of rod photoreceptors in mouse retina, and show that rods can drive visual responses in photopic conditions.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Clinical applications visual explanation tools AI\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 9859710\n\nTitle = From data to deployment: the Collaborative Communities on Ophthalmic Imaging roadmap for artificial intelligence in age-related macular degeneration\n\nHealthcare systems worldwide are challenged to provide adequate care for the 200 million individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to make a significant positive impact on the diagnosis and management of patients with AMD. However, the development of effective AI devices for clinical care faces numerous considerations and challenges, a fact evidenced by a current absence of FDA-approved AI devices for AMD.\n\nTo delineate the state of AI for AMD including current data, standards, achievements, and challenges.\n\nEVIDENCE Members of the Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging working group for AI in AMD attended an inaugural meeting on September 7, 2020 to discuss the topic. Subsequently, they undertook a comprehensive review of the medical literature relevant to the topic. Members engaged in meetings and discussion through December 2021 to synthesize the information and arrive at consensus.\n\nExisting infrastructure for robust AI development for AMD includes several large, labeled datasets of color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. However, image data often does not contain meta-data necessary for the development of reliable, valid, and generalizable models. Data sharing for AMD model development is made difficult by restrictions on data privacy and security, although potential solutions are under investigation. Computing resources may be adequate for current applications, but knowledge of machine learning (ML) development may be scarce in many clinical ophthalmology settings. Despite these challenges, researchers have produced promising AI models for AMD for screening, diagnosis, prediction, and monitoring. Future goals include defining benchmarks to facilitate regulatory authorization and subsequent real-world generalization.\n\nDelivering an FDA-authorized, AI-based device for clinical care in AMD involves numerous considerations including the identification of an appropriate clinical application, acquisition and curation of a large, high-quality data set, development of the AI architecture, training and validation of the model, and functional interactions between the model output and clinical end-user.

Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 11172021\n\nTitle = Revolutionizing Cardiology through Artificial Intelligence\u2014Big Data from Proactive Prevention to Precise Diagnostics and Cutting-Edge Treatment\u2014A Comprehensive Review of the Past 5 Years\n\nBackground: Artificial intelligence (AI) can radically change almost every aspect of the human experience.

Cardiology is not immune to this trend, this fact being supported by the exponential increase in the number of publications in which the algorithms play an important role in data analysis, pattern discovery, identification of anomalies, and therapeutic decision making. Furthermore, with technological development, there have appeared new models of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DP) that are capable of exploring various applications of AI in cardiology, including areas such as prevention, cardiovascular imaging, electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, and many others. In this sense, the present article aims to provide a general vision of the current state of AI use in cardiology. Results: We identified and included a subset of 200 papers directly relevant to the current research covering a wide range of applications. Thus, this paper presents AI applications in cardiovascular imaging, arithmology, clinical or emergency cardiology, cardiovascular prevention, and interventional procedures in a summarized manner. Recent studies from the highly scientific literature demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using AI in different branches of cardiology. Conclusions: The integration of AI in cardiology offers promising perspectives for increasing accuracy by decreasing the error rate and increasing efficiency in cardiovascular practice. From predicting the risk of sudden death or the ability to respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or the early detection of valvular diseases, AI algorithms have shown their potential to mitigate human error and provide feasible solutions. At the same time, limits imposed by the small samples studied are highlighted alongside the challenges presented by ethical implementation; these relate to legal implications regarding responsibility and decision making processes, ensuring patient confidentiality and data security. All these constitute future research directions that will allow the integration of AI in the progress of cardiology. \n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 8459787\n\nTitle = Unbox the black-box for the medical explainable AI via multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion: A mini-review, two showcases and beyond\n\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging research topic of machine learning aimed at unboxing how AI systems\u2019 black-box choices are made. This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms cannot manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions.\n\nWe performed a mini-review for XAI in medicine and digital healthcare.\n\nOur mini-review is comprehensive on most recent studies of XAI in the medical field.\n\nWe proposed two XAI methods and constructed two representative showcases.\n\nOne of our XAI models is based on weakly supervised learning for COVID-19 classification.\n\nOne of our XAI models is developed for ventricle segmentation in hydrocephalus patients.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Clinician trust visual explanation tools AI\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11890136\n\nTitle = Prioritizing Trust in Podiatrists\u2019 Preference for AI in Supportive Roles Over Diagnostic Roles in Health Care: Qualitative Interview and Focus Group Study\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) evolves, its roles have expanded from helping out with routine tasks to making complex decisions, once the exclusive domain of human experts. This shift is pronounced in health care, where AI aids in tasks ranging from image recognition in radiology to personalized treatment plans, demonstrating the potential to, at times, surpass human accuracy and efficiency. Despite AI\u2019s accuracy in some critical tasks, the adoption of AI in health care is a challenge, in part because of skepticism about being able to rely on AI decisions.\n\nThis study aimed to identify and delve into more effective and acceptable ways of integrating AI into a broader spectrum of health care tasks.\n\nWe included 2 qualitative phases to explore podiatrists\u2019 views on AI in health care. Initially, we interviewed 9 podiatrists (7 women and 2 men) with a mean age of 41 (SD 12) years and aimed to capture their sentiments regarding the use and role of AI in their work. Subsequently, a focus group with 5 podiatrists (4 women and 1 man) with a mean age of 54 (SD 10) years delved into AI\u2019s supportive and diagnostic roles on the basis of the interviews. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using Atlas.ti and QDA-Miner, using both thematic analysis for broad patterns and framework analysis for structured insights per established guidelines.\n\nOur research unveiled 9 themes and 3 subthemes, clarifying podiatrists\u2019 nuanced views on AI in health care. Key overlapping insights in the 2 phases included a preference for using AI in supportive roles, such as triage, because of its efficiency and process optimization capabilities. There is a discernible hesitancy toward leveraging AI for diagnostic purposes, driven by concerns regarding its accuracy and the essential nature of human expertise. The need for transparency and explainability in AI systems emerged as a critical factor for fostering trust in both phases.\n\nThe findings highlight a complex view from podiatrists on AI, showing openness to its application in supportive roles while exercising caution with diagnostic use. This result is consistent with a careful introduction of AI into health care in roles, such as triage, in which there is initial trust, as opposed to roles that ask the AI for a complete diagnosis. Such strategic adoption can mitigate initial resistance, gradually building the confidence to explore AI\u2019s capabilities in more nuanced tasks, including diagnostics, where skepticism is currently more pronounced. Adopting AI stepwise could thus enhance trust and acceptance across a broader range of health care tasks, aligning technology integration with professional comfort and patient care standards.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11459539\n\nTitle = Engaging with artificial intelligence in mammography screening: Swedish breast radiologists\u2019 views on trust, information and expertise\n\nLack of trust and transparency is stressed as a challenge for clinical implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). In breast cancer screening, AI-supported reading shows promising results but more research is needed on how medical experts, which are facing the integration of AI into their work, reason about trust and information needs. From a sociotechnical information practice perspective, we add to this knowledge by a Swedish case study. This study aims to: (1) clarify Swedish breast radiologists\u2019 views on trust, information and expertise pertaining to AI in mammography screening and (2) analytically address ideas about medical professionals\u2019 critical engagement with AI and motivations for trust in AI.\n\nAn online survey was distributed to Swedish breast radiologists. Survey responses were analysed by descriptive statistical method, correlation analysis and qualitative content analysis. The results were used as foundation for analysing trust and information as parts of critical engagements with AI.\n\nOf the Swedish breast radiologists (n\u2009=\u2009105), 47 answered the survey (response rate\u2009=\u200944.8%). 53.2% (n\u2009=\u200925) of the respondents would to a high/somewhat high degree trust AI assessments. To a great extent, additional information would support the respondents\u2019 trust evaluations. What type of critical engagement medical professionals are expected to perform on AI as decision support remains unclear.\n\nThere is a demand for enhanced information, explainability and transparency of AI-supported mammography. Further discussion and agreement are needed considering what the desired goals for trust in AI should be and how it relates to medical professionals\u2019 critical evaluation of AI-made claims in medical decision support.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 8600426\n\nTitle = The Impact of Explanations on Layperson Trust in Artificial Intelligence\u2013Driven Symptom Checker Apps: Experimental Study\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\u2013driven symptom checkers are available to millions of users globally and are advocated as a tool to deliver health care more efficiently. To achieve the promoted benefits of a symptom checker, laypeople must trust and subsequently follow its instructions. In AI, explanations are seen as a tool to communicate the rationale behind black-box decisions to encourage trust and adoption. However, the effectiveness of the types of explanations used in AI-driven symptom checkers has not yet been studied. Explanations can follow many forms, including why-explanations and how-explanations. Social theories suggest that why-explanations are better at communicating knowledge and cultivating trust among laypeople.\n\nThe aim of this study is to ascertain whether explanations provided by a symptom checker affect explanatory trust among laypeople and whether this trust is impacted by their existing knowledge of disease.\n\nA cross-sectional survey of 750 healthy participants was conducted. The participants were shown a video of a chatbot simulation that resulted in the diagnosis of either a migraine or temporal arteritis, chosen for their differing levels of epidemiological prevalence. These diagnoses were accompanied by one of four types of explanations. Each explanation type was selected either because of its current use in symptom checkers or because it was informed by theories of contrastive explanation. Exploratory factor analysis of participants\u2019 responses followed by comparison-of-means tests were used to evaluate group differences in trust.\n\nDepending on the treatment group, two or three variables were generated, reflecting the prior knowledge and subsequent mental model that the participants held. When varying explanation type by disease, migraine was found to be nonsignificant (P=.65) and temporal arteritis, marginally significant (P=.09). Varying disease by explanation type resulted in statistical significance for input influence (P=.001), social proof (P=.049), and no explanation (P=.006), with counterfactual explanation (P=.053). The results suggest that trust in explanations is significantly affected by the disease being explained. When laypeople have existing knowledge of a disease, explanations have little impact on trust. Where the need for information is greater, different explanation types engender significantly different levels of trust. These results indicate that to be successful, symptom checkers need to tailor explanations to each user\u2019s specific question and discount the diseases that they may also be aware of.\n\nSystem builders developing explanations for symptom-checking apps should consider the recipient\u2019s knowledge of a disease and tailor explanations to each user\u2019s specific need. Effort should be placed on generating explanations that are personalized to each user of a symptom checker to fully discount the diseases that they may be aware of and to close their information gap.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 10630476\n\nTitle = Quantifying the impact of AI recommendations with explanations on prescription decision making\n\nThe influence of AI recommendations on physician behaviour remains poorly characterised. We assess how clinicians\u2019 decisions may be influenced by additional information more broadly, and how this influence can be modified by either the source of the information (human peers or AI) and the presence or absence of an AI explanation (XAI, here using simple feature importance). We used a modified between-subjects design where intensive care doctors (N\u2009=\u200986) were presented on a computer for each of 16 trials with a patient case and prompted to prescribe continuous values for two drugs. We used a multi-factorial experimental design with four arms, where each clinician experienced all four arms on different subsets of our 24 patients. The four arms were (i) baseline (control), (ii) peer human clinician scenario showing what doses had been prescribed by other doctors, (iii) AI suggestion and (iv) XAI suggestion. We found that additional information (peer, AI or XAI) had a strong influence on prescriptions (significantly for AI, not so for peers) but simple XAI did not have higher influence than AI alone. There was no correlation between attitudes to AI or clinical experience on the AI-supported decisions and nor was there correlation between what doctors self-reported about how useful they found the XAI and whether the XAI actually influenced their prescriptions. Our findings suggest that the marginal impact of simple XAI was low in this setting and we also cast doubt on the utility of self-reports as a valid metric for assessing XAI in clinical experts.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 11041414\n\nTitle = The Impact of Expectation Management and Model Transparency on Radiologists\u2019 Trust and Utilization of AI Recommendations for Lung Nodule Assessment on Computed Tomography: Simulated Use Study\n\nMany promising artificial intelligence (AI) and computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems have been developed, but few have been successfully integrated into clinical practice. This is partially owing to a lack of user-centered design of AI-based computer-aided detection or diagnosis (AI-CAD) systems.\n\nWe aimed to assess the impact of different onboarding tutorials and levels of AI model explainability on radiologists\u2019 trust in AI and the use of AI recommendations in lung nodule assessment on computed tomography (CT) scans.\n\nIn total, 20 radiologists from 7 Dutch medical centers performed lung nodule assessment on CT scans under different conditions in a simulated use study as part of a 2\u00d72 repeated-measures quasi-experimental design. Two types of AI onboarding tutorials (reflective vs informative) and 2 levels of AI output (black box vs explainable) were designed. The radiologists first received an onboarding tutorial that was either informative or reflective. Subsequently, each radiologist assessed 7 CT scans, first without AI recommendations. AI recommendations were shown to the radiologist, and they could adjust their initial assessment. Half of the participants received the recommendations via black box AI output and half received explainable AI output. Mental model and psychological trust were measured before onboarding, after onboarding, and after assessing the 7 CT scans. We recorded whether radiologists changed their assessment on found nodules, malignancy prediction, and follow-up advice for each CT assessment. In addition, we analyzed whether radiologists\u2019 trust in their assessments had changed based on the AI recommendations.\n\nBoth variations of onboarding tutorials resulted in a significantly improved mental model of the AI-CAD system (informative P=.01 and reflective P=.01). After using AI-CAD, psychological trust significantly decreased for the group with explainable AI output (P=.02). On the basis of the AI recommendations, radiologists changed the number of reported nodules in 27 of 140 assessments, malignancy prediction in 32 of 140 assessments, and follow-up advice in 12 of 140 assessments. The changes were mostly an increased number of reported nodules, a higher estimated probability of malignancy, and earlier follow-up. The radiologists\u2019 confidence in their found nodules changed in 82 of 140 assessments, in their estimated probability of malignancy in 50 of 140 assessments, and in their follow-up advice in 28 of 140 assessments. These changes were predominantly increases in confidence. The number of changed assessments and radiologists\u2019 confidence did not significantly differ between the groups that received different onboarding tutorials and AI outputs.\n\nOnboarding tutorials help radiologists gain a better understanding of AI-CAD and facilitate the formation of a correct mental model. If AI explanations do not consistently substantiate the probability of malignancy across patient cases, radiologists\u2019 trust in the AI-CAD system can be impaired. Radiologists\u2019 confidence in their assessments was improved by using the AI recommendations.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n"
