## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Computational Linguist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Token-level attribution with SHAP and LIME in medical LLMs in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Token-level attribution with SHAP and LIME in medical LLMs to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Token-level attribution with SHAP and LIME in medical LLMs. Include both general queries about Token-level attribution with SHAP and LIME in medical LLMs and queries that specifically relate Token-level attribution with SHAP and LIME in medical LLMs to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Token-level attribution with SHAP and LIME in medical LLMs (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Computational Linguist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Computational Linguist

To effectively search for relevant scientific papers on Token-level attribution with SHAP and LIME in medical LLMs, particularly in the context of LLM interpretability for electronic phenotype definitions, I have crafted a series of search queries. These queries aim to cover both general aspects and specific applications related to clinical contexts and clinician trust. Here are the queries in Python syntax:

```python
queries = [
    "Token-level attribution SHAP LIME medical large language models",
    "SHAP LIME interpretability electronic phenotype definitions",
    "Token-level attribution LLM interpretability clinical applications",
    "SHAP LIME clinician trust medical LLMs",
    "Token-level attribution SNOMED CT integration medical LLMs"
]
```

These queries are designed to capture a broad spectrum of literature, from foundational concepts of token-level attribution using SHAP and LIME in medical contexts to more focused studies on their application in phenotype definitions and clinician trust. By running these queries, we aim to gather comprehensive insights that will inform the development of a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
