These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems\u2014patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients\u2014and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11523650\n\nTitle = A review on the efficacy of artificial intelligence for managing anxiety disorders\n\nAnxiety disorders are psychiatric conditions characterized by prolonged and generalized anxiety experienced by individuals in response to various events or situations. At present, anxiety disorders are regarded as the most widespread psychiatric disorders globally. Medication and different types of psychotherapies are employed as the primary therapeutic modalities in clinical practice for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, combining these two approaches is known to yield more significant benefits than medication alone. Nevertheless, there is a lack of resources and a limited availability of psychotherapy options in underdeveloped areas. Psychotherapy methods encompass relaxation techniques, controlled breathing exercises, visualization exercises, controlled exposure exercises, and cognitive interventions such as challenging negative thoughts. These methods are vital in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but executing them proficiently can be demanding. Moreover, individuals with distinct anxiety disorders are prescribed medications that may cause withdrawal symptoms in some instances. Additionally, there is inadequate availability of face-to-face psychotherapy and a restricted capacity to predict and monitor the health, behavioral, and environmental aspects of individuals with anxiety disorders during the initial phases. In recent years, there has been notable progress in developing and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) based applications and environments to improve the precision and sensitivity of diagnosing and treating various categories of anxiety disorders. As a result, this study aims to establish the efficacy of AI-enabled environments in addressing the existing challenges in managing anxiety disorders, reducing reliance on medication, and investigating the potential advantages, issues, and opportunities of integrating AI-assisted healthcare for anxiety disorders and enabling personalized therapy.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 6157254\n\nTitle = Proceedings of the 4th IPLeiria\u2019s International Health Congress\n\n\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 10956028\n\nTitle = GaNDLF: the generally nuanced deep learning framework for scalable end-to-end clinical workflows\n\nDeep Learning (DL) has the potential to optimize machine learning in both the scientific and clinical communities. However, greater expertise is required to develop DL algorithms, and the variability of implementations hinders their reproducibility, translation, and deployment. Here we present the community-driven Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework (GaNDLF), with the goal of lowering these barriers. GaNDLF makes the mechanism of DL development, training, and inference more stable, reproducible, interpretable, and scalable, without requiring an extensive technical background. GaNDLF aims to provide an end-to-end solution for all DL-related tasks in computational precision medicine. We demonstrate the ability of GaNDLF to analyze both radiology and histology images, with built-in support for k-fold cross-validation, data augmentation, multiple modalities and output classes. Our quantitative performance evaluation on numerous use cases, anatomies, and computational tasks supports GaNDLF as a robust application framework for deployment in clinical workflows.\n\nThe increasing complexity of the implementation and operation of deep learning techniques hinders their reproducibility and deployment at scale, especially in healthcare. Pati and colleagues introduce a deep learning framework to analyse healthcare data without requiring extensive computational experience, facilitating the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical workflows.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 10956174\n\nTitle = Proceedings of the 2023 International Maternal Newborn Health Conference\n\n\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11422740\n\nTitle = Prompt Engineering Paradigms for Medical Applications: Scoping Review\n\nPrompt engineering, focusing on crafting effective prompts to large language models (LLMs), has garnered attention for its capabilities at harnessing the potential of LLMs. This is even more crucial in the medical domain due to its specialized terminology and language technicity. Clinical natural language processing applications must navigate complex language and ensure privacy compliance. Prompt engineering offers a novel approach by designing tailored prompts to guide models in exploiting clinically relevant information from complex medical texts. Despite its promise, the efficacy of prompt engineering in the medical domain remains to be fully explored.\n\nThe aim of the study is to review research efforts and technical approaches in prompt engineering for medical applications as well as provide an overview of opportunities and challenges for clinical practice.\n\nDatabases indexing the fields of medicine, computer science, and medical informatics were queried in order to identify relevant published papers. Since prompt engineering is an emerging field, preprint databases were also considered. Multiple data were extracted, such as the prompt paradigm, the involved LLMs, the languages of the study, the domain of the topic, the baselines, and several learning, design, and architecture strategies specific to prompt engineering. We include studies that apply prompt engineering\u2013based methods to the medical domain, published between 2022 and 2024, and covering multiple prompt paradigms such as prompt learning (PL), prompt tuning (PT), and prompt design (PD).\n\nWe included 114 recent prompt engineering studies. Among the 3 prompt paradigms, we have observed that PD is the most prevalent (78 papers). In 12 papers, PD, PL, and PT terms were used interchangeably. While ChatGPT is the most commonly used LLM, we have identified 7 studies using this LLM on a sensitive clinical data set. Chain-of-thought, present in 17 studies, emerges as the most frequent PD technique. While PL and PT papers typically provide a baseline for evaluating prompt-based approaches, 61% (48/78) of the PD studies do not report any nonprompt-related baseline. Finally, we individually examine each of the key prompt engineering\u2013specific information reported across papers and find that many studies neglect to explicitly mention them, posing a challenge for advancing prompt engineering research.\n\nIn addition to reporting on trends and the scientific landscape of prompt engineering, we provide reporting guidelines for future studies to help advance research in the medical field. We also disclose tables and figures summarizing medical prompt engineering papers available and hope that future contributions will leverage these existing works to better advance the field.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 10689487\n\nTitle = Zero-shot interpretable phenotyping of postpartum hemorrhage using large language models\n\nMany areas of medicine would benefit from deeper, more accurate phenotyping, but there are limited approaches for phenotyping using clinical notes without substantial annotated data. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential to adapt to novel tasks with no additional training by specifying task-specific instructions. Here we report the performance of a publicly available LLM, Flan-T5, in phenotyping patients with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) using discharge notes from electronic health records (n\u2009=\u2009271,081). The language model achieves strong performance in extracting 24 granular concepts associated with PPH. Identifying these granular concepts accurately allows the development of interpretable, complex phenotypes and subtypes. The Flan-T5 model achieves high fidelity in phenotyping PPH (positive predictive value of 0.95), identifying 47% more patients with this complication compared to the current standard of using claims codes. This LLM pipeline can be used reliably for subtyping PPH and outperforms a claims-based approach on the three most common PPH subtypes associated with uterine atony, abnormal placentation, and obstetric trauma. The advantage of this approach to subtyping is its interpretability, as each concept contributing to the subtype determination can be evaluated. Moreover, as definitions may change over time due to new guidelines, using granular concepts to create complex phenotypes enables prompt and efficient updating of the algorithm. Using this language modelling approach enables rapid phenotyping without the need for any manually annotated training data across multiple clinical use cases.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 11545079\n\nTitle = The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging: From Computer Science to Machine and Deep Learning\n\nArtificial intelligence, now one of the most promising frontiers of medicine, has a long and tumultuous history punctuated by successes and failures. One of its successes was its application to medical images. We reconstruct the timeline of the advancements in this field, from its origins in the 1940s before crossing medical images to early applications of machine learning to radiology, to the present era where artificial intelligence is revolutionizing radiology.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI), the wide spectrum of technologies aiming to give machines or computers the ability to perform human-like cognitive functions, began in the 1940s with the first abstract models of intelligent machines. Soon after, in the 1950s and 1960s, machine learning algorithms such as neural networks and decision trees ignited significant enthusiasm. More recent advancements include the refinement of learning algorithms, the development of convolutional neural networks to efficiently analyze images, and methods to synthesize new images. This renewed enthusiasm was also due to the increase in computational power with graphical processing units and the availability of large digital databases to be mined by neural networks. AI soon began to be applied in medicine, first through expert systems designed to support the clinician\u2019s decision and later with neural networks for the detection, classification, or segmentation of malignant lesions in medical images. A recent prospective clinical trial demonstrated the non-inferiority of AI alone compared with a double reading by two radiologists on screening mammography. Natural language processing, recurrent neural networks, transformers, and generative models have both improved the capabilities of making an automated reading of medical images and moved AI to new domains, including the text analysis of electronic health records, image self-labeling, and self-reporting. The availability of open-source and free libraries, as well as powerful computing resources, has greatly facilitated the adoption of deep learning by researchers and clinicians. Key concerns surrounding AI in healthcare include the need for clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy, the perception of AI tools as \u2018black boxes\u2019 that require greater interpretability and explainability, and ethical issues related to ensuring fairness and trustworthiness in AI systems. Thanks to its versatility and impressive results, AI is one of the most promising resources for frontier research and applications in medicine, in particular for oncological applications.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 3302143\n\nTitle = Proximal correlates of metabolic phenotypes during \u2018at-risk' and \u2018case' stages of the metabolic disease continuum\n\nTo examine the social and behavioural correlates of metabolic phenotypes during \u2018at-risk' and \u2018case' stages of the metabolic disease continuum.\n\nCross-sectional study of a random population sample.\n\nA total of 718 community-dwelling adults (57% female), aged 18\u201392 years from a regional South Australian city.\n\nTotal body fat and lean mass and abdominal fat mass were assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Fasting venous blood was collected in the morning for assessment of glycated haemoglobin, plasma glucose, serum triglycerides, cholesterol lipoproteins and insulin. Seated blood pressure (BP) was measured. Physical activity and smoking, alcohol and diet (96-item food frequency), sleep duration and frequency of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms, and family history of cardiometabolic disease, education, lifetime occupation and household income were assessed by questionnaire. Current medications were determined by clinical inventory.\n\n36.5% were pharmacologically managed for a metabolic risk factor or had known diabetes (\u2018cases'), otherwise were classified as the \u2018at-risk' population. In both \u2018at-risk' and \u2018cases', four major metabolic phenotypes were identified using principal components analysis that explained over 77% of the metabolic variance between people: fat mass/insulinemia (FMI); BP; lipidaemia/lean mass (LLM) and glycaemia (GLY). The BP phenotype was uncorrelated with other phenotypes in \u2018cases', whereas all phenotypes were inter-correlated in the \u2018at-risk'. Over and above other socioeconomic and behavioural factors, medications were the dominant correlates of all phenotypes in \u2018cases' and SDB symptom frequency was most strongly associated with FMI, LLM and GLY phenotypes in the \u2018at-risk'.\n\nPrevious research has shown FMI, LLM and GLY phenotypes to be most strongly predictive of diabetes development. Reducing SDB symptom frequency and optimising the duration of sleep may be important concomitant interventions to standard diabetes risk reduction interventions. Prospective studies are required to examine this hypothesis.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 11460004\n\nTitle = A hybrid framework with large language models for rare disease phenotyping\n\nRare diseases pose significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to their low prevalence and heterogeneous clinical presentations. Unstructured clinical notes contain valuable information for identifying rare diseases, but manual curation is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. This study aims to develop a hybrid approach combining dictionary-based natural language processing (NLP) tools with large language models (LLMs) to improve rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports.\n\nWe propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to create a comprehensive rare disease vocabulary. SemEHR, a dictionary-based NLP tool, is employed to extract rare disease mentions from clinical notes. To refine the results and improve accuracy, we leverage various LLMs, including LLaMA3, Phi3-mini, and domain-specific models like OpenBioLLM and BioMistral. Different prompting strategies, such as zero-shot, few-shot, and knowledge-augmented generation, are explored to optimize the LLMs\u2019 performance.\n\nThe proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional NLP systems and standalone LLMs. LLaMA3 and Phi3-mini achieve the highest F1 scores in rare disease identification. Few-shot prompting with 1-3 examples yields the best results, while knowledge-augmented generation shows limited improvement. Notably, the approach uncovers a significant number of potential rare disease cases not documented in structured diagnostic records, highlighting its ability to identify previously unrecognized patients.\n\nThe hybrid approach combining dictionary-based NLP tools with LLMs shows great promise for improving rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, the method demonstrates superior performance and the potential to uncover hidden rare disease cases. Further research is needed to address limitations related to ontology mapping and overlapping case identification, and to integrate the approach into clinical practice for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12911-024-02698-7.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Visual analytics for clinician trust in AI outputs\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 7490784\n\nTitle = Reporting guidelines for clinical trial reports for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the CONSORT-AI Extension\n\nThe CONSORT 2010 (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomised trials.

However, its clinical adoption has been slower than anticipated, largely due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. Existing frameworks remain insufficient and tend to emphasize technical metrics such as accuracy and validation, while overlooking critical real-world factors such as clinical impact, integration, and economic sustainability. This narrow focus prevents AI tools from being effectively implemented, limiting their broader impact and long-term viability in clinical practice.\n\nThis study aimed to create a framework for assessing AI in health care, extending beyond technical metrics to incorporate social and organizational dimensions. The framework was developed by systematically reviewing, analyzing, and synthesizing the evaluation criteria necessary for successful implementation, focusing on the long-term real-world impact of AI in clinical practice.\n\nA search was performed in July 2024 across the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases to identify relevant studies published in English between January 2019 and mid-July 2024, yielding 3528 results, among which 44 studies met the inclusion criteria. The systematic review followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Data were analyzed using NVivo through thematic analysis and narrative synthesis to identify key emergent themes in the studies.\n\nBy synthesizing the included studies, we developed a framework that goes beyond the traditional focus on technical metrics or study-level methodologies. It integrates clinical context and real-world implementation factors, offering a more comprehensive approach to evaluating AI tools. With our focus on assessing the long-term real-world impact of AI technologies in health care, we named the framework AI for IMPACTS. The criteria are organized into seven key clusters, each corresponding to a letter in the acronym: (1) I\u2014integration, interoperability, and workflow; (2) M\u2014monitoring, governance, and accountability; (3) P\u2014performance and quality metrics; (4) A\u2014acceptability, trust, and training; (5) C\u2014cost and economic evaluation; (6) T\u2014technological safety and transparency; and (7) S\u2014scalability and impact. These are further broken down into 28 specific subcriteria.\n\nThe AI for IMPACTS framework offers a holistic approach to evaluate the long-term real-world impact of AI tools in the heterogeneous and challenging health care context and lays the groundwork for further validation through expert consensus and testing of the framework in real-world health care settings. It is important to emphasize that multidisciplinary expertise is essential for assessment, yet many assessors lack the necessary training. In addition, traditional evaluation methods struggle to keep pace with AI\u2019s rapid development. To ensure successful AI integration, flexible, fast-tracked assessment processes and proper assessor training are needed to maintain rigorous standards while adapting to AI\u2019s dynamic evolution.\n\nreviewregistry1859; https://tinyurl.com/ysn2d7sh\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 11329852\n\nTitle = Implementing AI in Hospitals to Achieve a Learning Health System: Systematic Review of Current Enablers and Barriers\n\nEfforts are underway to capitalize on the computational power of the data collected in electronic medical records (EMRs) to achieve a learning health system (LHS). Artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has promised to improve clinical outcomes, and many researchers are developing AI algorithms on retrospective data sets. Integrating these algorithms with real-time EMR data is rare. There is a poor understanding of the current enablers and barriers to empower this shift from data set\u2013based use to real-time implementation of AI in health systems. Exploring these factors holds promise for uncovering actionable insights toward the successful integration of AI into clinical workflows.\n\nThe first objective was to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the evidence of enablers and barriers regarding the real-world implementation of AI in hospital settings. The second objective was to map the identified enablers and barriers to a 3-horizon framework to enable the successful digital health transformation of hospitals to achieve an LHS.\n\nThe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were adhered to. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore were searched for studies published between January 2010 and January 2022. Articles with case studies and guidelines on the implementation of AI analytics in hospital settings using EMR data were included. We excluded studies conducted in primary and community care settings. Quality assessment of the identified papers was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and ADAPTE frameworks. We coded evidence from the included studies that related to enablers of and barriers to AI implementation. The findings were mapped to the 3-horizon framework to provide a road map for hospitals to integrate AI analytics.\n\nOf the 1247 studies screened, 26 (2.09%) met the inclusion criteria. In total, 65% (17/26) of the studies implemented AI analytics for enhancing the care of hospitalized patients, whereas the remaining 35% (9/26) provided implementation guidelines. Of the final 26 papers, the quality of 21 (81%) was assessed as poor. A total of 28 enablers was identified; 8 (29%) were new in this study. A total of 18 barriers was identified; 5 (28%) were newly found. Most of these newly identified factors were related to information and technology. Actionable recommendations for the implementation of AI toward achieving an LHS were provided by mapping the findings to a 3-horizon framework.\n\nSignificant issues exist in implementing AI in health care. Shifting from validating data sets to working with live data is challenging. This review incorporated the identified enablers and barriers into a 3-horizon framework, offering actionable recommendations for implementing AI analytics to achieve an LHS.

We used AI-ECG retrained to interpret single-lead ECG input alone. Patients (aged \u226518 years) attending for transthoracic echocardiogram in London (UK) were recruited. All participants had 15 s of supine, single-lead ECG recorded at the four standard anatomical positions for cardiac auscultation, plus one handheld position, using an ECG-enabled stethoscope. Transthoracic echocardiogram-derived percentage LVEF was used as ground truth. The primary outcome was performance of AI-ECG at classifying reduced LVEF (LVEF \u226440%), measured using metrics including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity, with two-sided 95% CIs. The primary outcome was reported for each position individually and with an optimal combination of AI-ECG outputs (interval range 0\u20131) from two positions using a rule-based approach and several classification models. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04601415.\n\nBetween Feb 6 and May 27, 2021, we recruited 1050 patients (mean age 62 years [SD 17\u00b74], 535 [51%] male, 432 [41%] non-White). 945 (90%) had an ejection fraction of at least 40%, and 105 (10%) had an ejection fraction of 40% or lower. Across all positions, ECGs were most frequently of adequate quality for AI-ECG interpretation at the pulmonary position (979 [93\u00b73%] of 1050). Quality was lowest for the aortic position (846 [80\u00b76%]). AI-ECG performed best at the pulmonary valve position (p=0\u00b702), with an AUROC of 0\u00b785 (95% CI 0\u00b781\u20130\u00b789), sensitivity of 84\u00b78% (76\u00b72\u201391\u00b73), and specificity of 69\u00b75% (66\u00b74\u201372\u00b76). Diagnostic odds ratios did not differ by age, sex, or non-White ethnicity. Taking the optimal combination of two positions (pulmonary and handheld positions), the rule-based approach resulted in an AUROC of 0\u00b785 (0\u00b781\u20130\u00b789), sensitivity of 82\u00b77% (72\u00b77\u201390\u00b72), and specificity of 79\u00b79% (77\u00b70\u201382\u00b76). Using AI-ECG outputs from these two positions, a weighted logistic regression with l2 regularisation resulted in an AUROC of 0\u00b791 (0\u00b788\u20130\u00b795), sensitivity of 91\u00b79% (78\u00b71\u201398\u00b73), and specificity of 80\u00b72% (75\u00b75\u201384\u00b73).\n\nA deep learning system applied to single-lead ECGs acquired during a routine examination with an ECG-enabled stethoscope can detect LVEF of 40% or lower. These findings highlight the potential for inexpensive, non-invasive, workflow-adapted, point-of-care screening, for earlier diagnosis and prognostically beneficial treatment.\n\nNHS Accelerated Access Collaborative, NHSX, and the National Institute for Health Research.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"SNOMED CT integration in clinical AI interpretability\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11494256\n\nTitle = Use of SNOMED CT in Large Language Models: Scoping Review\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities but often struggle with knowledge-driven tasks in specialized domains such as biomedicine. Integrating biomedical knowledge sources such as SNOMED CT into LLMs may enhance their performance on biomedical tasks. However, the methodologies and effectiveness of incorporating SNOMED CT into LLMs have not been systematically reviewed.\n\nThis scoping review aims to examine how SNOMED CT is integrated into LLMs, focusing on (1) the types and components of LLMs being integrated with SNOMED CT, (2) which contents of SNOMED CT are being integrated, and (3) whether this integration improves LLM performance on NLP tasks.\n\nFollowing the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, we searched ACM Digital Library, ACL Anthology, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Embase for relevant studies published from 2018 to 2023. Studies were included if they incorporated SNOMED CT into LLM pipelines for natural language understanding or generation tasks. Data on LLM types, SNOMED CT integration methods, end tasks, and performance metrics were extracted and synthesized.\n\nThe review included 37 studies. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and its biomedical variants were the most commonly used LLMs. Three main approaches for integrating SNOMED CT were identified: (1) incorporating SNOMED CT into LLM inputs (28/37, 76%), primarily using concept descriptions to expand training corpora; (2) integrating SNOMED CT into additional fusion modules (5/37, 14%); and (3) using SNOMED CT as an external knowledge retriever during inference (5/37, 14%). The most frequent end task was medical concept normalization (15/37, 41%), followed by entity extraction or typing and classification. While most studies (17/19, 89%) reported performance improvements after SNOMED CT integration, only a small fraction (19/37, 51%) provided direct comparisons. The reported gains varied widely across different metrics and tasks, ranging from 0.87% to 131.66%. However, some studies showed either no improvement or a decline in certain performance metrics.\n\nThis review demonstrates diverse approaches for integrating SNOMED CT into LLMs, with a focus on using concept descriptions to enhance biomedical language understanding and generation. While the results suggest potential benefits of SNOMED CT integration, the lack of standardized evaluation methods and comprehensive performance reporting hinders definitive conclusions about its effectiveness. Future research should prioritize consistent reporting of performance comparisons and explore more sophisticated methods for incorporating SNOMED CT\u2019s relational structure into LLMs. In addition, the biomedical NLP community should develop standardized evaluation frameworks to better assess the impact of ontology integration on LLM performance.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 10767798\n\nTitle = Natural Language Processing to extract SNOMED-CT codes from pathological reports\n\nThe use of standardized structured reports (SSR) and suitable terminologies like SNOMED-CT can enhance data retrieval and analysis, fostering large-scale studies and collaboration. However, the still large prevalence of narrative reports in our laboratories warrants alternative and automated labeling approaches. In this project, natural language processing (NLP) methods were used to associate SNOMED-CT codes to structured and unstructured reports from an Italian Digital Pathology Department.\n\nTwo NLP-based automatic coding systems (support vector machine, SVM, and long-short term memory, LSTM) were trained and applied to a series of narrative reports.\n\nThe 1163 cases were tested with both algorithms, showing good performances in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with SVM showing slightly better performances as compared to LSTM (0.84, 0.87, 0.83, 0.82 vs 0.83, 0.85, 0.83, 0.82, respectively). The integration of an explainability allowed identification of terms and groups of words of importance, enabling fine-tuning, balancing semantic meaning and model performance.\n\nAI tools allow the automatic SNOMED-CT labeling of the pathology archives, providing a retrospective fix to the large lack of organization of narrative reports.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 11336492\n\nTitle = Enhancing Clinical Relevance of Pretrained Language Models Through Integration of External Knowledge: Case Study on Cardiovascular Diagnosis From Electronic Health Records\n\nDespite their growing use in health care, pretrained language models (PLMs) often lack clinical relevance due to insufficient domain expertise and poor interpretability. A key strategy to overcome these challenges is integrating external knowledge into PLMs, enhancing their adaptability and clinical usefulness. Current biomedical knowledge graphs like UMLS (Unified Medical Language System), SNOMED CT (Systematized Medical Nomenclature for Medicine\u2013Clinical Terminology), and HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology), while comprehensive, fail to effectively connect general biomedical knowledge with physician insights. There is an equally important need for a model that integrates diverse knowledge in a way that is both unified and compartmentalized. This approach not only addresses the heterogeneous nature of domain knowledge but also recognizes the unique data and knowledge repositories of individual health care institutions, necessitating careful and respectful management of proprietary information.\n\nThis study aimed to enhance the clinical relevance and interpretability of PLMs by integrating external knowledge in a manner that respects the diversity and proprietary nature of health care data. We hypothesize that domain knowledge, when captured and distributed as stand-alone modules, can be effectively reintegrated into PLMs to significantly improve their adaptability and utility in clinical settings.\n\nWe demonstrate that through adapters, small and lightweight neural networks that enable the integration of extra information without full model fine-tuning, we can inject diverse sources of external domain knowledge into language models and improve the overall performance with an increased level of interpretability. As a practical application of this methodology, we introduce a novel task, structured as a case study, that endeavors to capture physician knowledge in assigning cardiovascular diagnoses from clinical narratives, where we extract diagnosis-comment pairs from electronic health records (EHRs) and cast the problem as text classification.\n\nThe study demonstrates that integrating domain knowledge into PLMs significantly improves their performance. While improvements with ClinicalBERT are more modest, likely due to its pretraining on clinical texts, BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformer) equipped with knowledge adapters surprisingly matches or exceeds ClinicalBERT in several metrics. This underscores the effectiveness of knowledge adapters and highlights their potential in settings with strict data privacy constraints. This approach also increases the level of interpretability of these models in a clinical context, which enhances our ability to precisely identify and apply the most relevant domain knowledge for specific tasks, thereby optimizing the model\u2019s performance and tailoring it to meet specific clinical needs.\n\nThis research provides a basis for creating health knowledge graphs infused with physician knowledge, marking a significant step forward for PLMs in health care. Notably, the model balances integrating knowledge both comprehensively and selectively, addressing the heterogeneous nature of medical knowledge and the privacy needs of health care institutions.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 6849172\n\nTitle = Exploring semantic deep learning for building reliable and reusable one health knowledge from PubMed systematic reviews and veterinary clinical notes\n\nDeep Learning opens up opportunities for routinely scanning large bodies of biomedical literature and clinical narratives to represent the meaning of biomedical and clinical terms. However, the validation and integration of this knowledge on a scale requires cross checking with ground truths (i.e. evidence-based resources) that are unavailable in an actionable or computable form. In this paper we explore how to turn information about diagnoses, prognoses, therapies and other clinical concepts into computable knowledge using free-text data about human and animal health. We used a Semantic Deep Learning approach that combines the Semantic Web technologies and Deep Learning to acquire and validate knowledge about 11 well-known medical conditions mined from two sets of unstructured free-text data: 300\u2009K PubMed Systematic Review articles (the PMSB dataset) and 2.5\u2009M veterinary clinical notes (the VetCN dataset). For each target condition we obtained 20 related clinical concepts using two deep learning methods applied separately on the two datasets, resulting in 880 term pairs (target term, candidate term). Each concept, represented by an n-gram, is mapped to UMLS using MetaMap; we also developed a bespoke method for mapping short forms (e.g. abbreviations and acronyms). Existing ontologies were used to formally represent associations. We also create ontological modules and illustrate how the extracted knowledge can be queried. The evaluation was performed using the content within BMJ Best Practice.\n\nMetaMap achieves an F measure of 88% (precision 85%, recall 91%) when applied directly to the total of 613 unique candidate terms for the 880 term pairs. When the processing of short forms is included, MetaMap achieves an F measure of 94% (precision 92%, recall 96%). Validation of the term pairs with BMJ Best Practice yields precision between 98 and 99%.\n\nThe Semantic Deep Learning approach can transform neural embeddings built from unstructured free-text data into reliable and reusable One Health knowledge using ontologies and content from BMJ Best Practice.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 9931276\n\nTitle = Diseasomics: Actionable machine interpretable disease knowledge at the point-of-care\n\nPhysicians establish diagnosis by assessing a patient\u2019s signs, symptoms, age, sex, laboratory test findings and the disease history. All this must be done in limited time and against the backdrop of an increasing overall workload. In the era of evidence-based medicine it is utmost important for a clinician to be abreast of the latest guidelines and treatment protocols which are changing rapidly. In resource limited settings, the updated knowledge often does not reach the point-of-care. This paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach for integrating comprehensive disease knowledge, to support physicians and healthcare workers in arriving at accurate diagnoses at the point-of-care. We integrated different disease-related knowledge bodies to construct a comprehensive, machine interpretable diseasomics knowledge-graph that includes the Disease Ontology, disease symptoms, SNOMED CT, DisGeNET, and PharmGKB data. The resulting disease-symptom network comprises knowledge from the Symptom Ontology, electronic health records (EHR), human symptom disease network, Disease Ontology, Wikipedia, PubMed, textbooks, and symptomology knowledge sources with 84.56% accuracy. We also integrated spatial and temporal comorbidity knowledge obtained from EHR for two population data sets from Spain and Sweden respectively. The knowledge graph is stored in a graph database as a digital twin of the disease knowledge. We use node2vec (node embedding) as digital triplet for link prediction in disease-symptom networks to identify missing associations. This diseasomics knowledge graph is expected to democratize the medical knowledge and empower non-specialist health workers to make evidence based informed decisions and help achieve the goal of universal health coverage (UHC). The machine interpretable knowledge graphs presented in this paper are associations between various entities and do not imply causation. Our differential diagnostic tool focusses on signs and symptoms and does not include a complete assessment of patient\u2019s lifestyle and health history which would typically be necessary to rule out conditions and to arrive at a final diagnosis. The predicted diseases are ordered according to the specific disease burden in South Asia. The knowledge graphs and the tools presented here can be used as a guide.\n\nA doctor at the point-of-care is expected to have the complete medical knowledge with latest updates in evidence-based medicine (EBM). The doctor is also expected to use this complete knowledge accurately during a medical interaction with a patient. In reality this is not the case\u2014there are gaps in knowledge acquisition and gaps in clinical decision making. To address these gaps, in the past AI based expert driven rule-based clinical decision support systems were developed. Rule-based systems are rigid and often fail in case of complex diseases. We therefore built an AI based evidence driven clinical decision support system. We mined PubMed, Wikipedia, textbooks, medical records, etc. to extract clinical knowledge. We used this clinical knowledge as glue to connect ontologies to construct a machine interpretable antireductionistic diseasomics knowledge graph. The diseasomics knowledge graph is stored in a Neo4j property graph database in a cloud for online and realtime access using JSON-RPC API and works like the physicians\u2019 brain digital twin. We used the digital triplet node2vec techniques to mine unknown knowledge and to create a learning healthcare system. The integrated diseasomics knowledge system is available for use at https://triage.cyberneticcare.com/diseasePrediction.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Machine learning interpretability in clinical applications\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 9870296\n\nTitle = Towards a safe and efficient clinical implementation of machine learning in radiation oncology by exploring model interpretability, explainability and data-model dependency\n\nThe interest for machine learning (ML) has grown tremendously in recent years, partly due to the performance leap that occurred with new techniques of deep learning, convolutional neural networks for images, increased computational power, and wider availability of large datasets. Most fields of medicine follow that popular trend and, notably, radiation oncology is one of those that are at the forefront, with already a long tradition in using digital images and fully computerized workflows. ML models are driven by data, and in contrast with many statistical or physical models, they can be very large and complex, with countless generic parameters. This inevitably raises two questions, namely, the tight dependence between the models and the datasets that feed them, and the interpretability of the models, which scales with its complexity. Any problems in the data used to train the model will be later reflected in their performance. This, together with the low interpretability of ML models, makes their implementation into the clinical workflow particularly difficult. Building tools for risk assessment and quality assurance of ML models must involve then two main points: interpretability and data-model dependency. After a joint introduction of both radiation oncology and ML, this paper reviews the main risks and current solutions when applying the latter to workflows in the former. Risks associated with data and models, as well as their interaction, are detailed. Next, the core concepts of interpretability, explainability, and data-model dependency are formally defined and illustrated with examples. Afterwards, a broad discussion goes through key applications of ML in workflows of radiation oncology as well as vendors\u2019 perspectives for the clinical implementation of ML.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11885302\n\nTitle = Advanced applications in chronic disease monitoring using IoT mobile sensing device data, machine learning algorithms and frame theory: a systematic review\n\nThe escalating demand for chronic disease management has presented substantial challenges to traditional methods. However, the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offers a potential resolution by facilitating more precise chronic disease management through data-driven strategies. This review concentrates on the utilization of IoT mobile sensing devices in managing major chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. It scrutinizes their efficacy in disease diagnosis and management when integrated with machine learning algorithms, such as ANN, SVM, RF, and deep learning models. Through an exhaustive literature review, this study dissects how these technologies aid in risk assessment, personalized treatment planning, and disease management. This research addresses a gap in the existing literature concerning the application of IoT and AI technologies in the management of specific chronic diseases. It particularly demonstrates methodological novelty by introducing advanced models based on deep learning, tight frame-based methodologies and real-time monitoring systems. This review employs a rigorous examination method, which includes systematically searching relevant databases, filtering literature that meets specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and adopting quality assessment tools to ensure the rigor of selected studies. This study identifies potential biases and weaknesses related to data collection, algorithm selection, and user interaction. The research demonstrates that platforms integrating IoT and machine learning algorithms for chronic disease monitoring and management are not only technically viable but also yield substantial economic and social advantages in real-world applications. Future studies could investigate the use of quantum computing for processing vast medical datasets and novel techniques that merge biosensors with nanotechnology for drug delivery and disease surveillance. Furthermore, this paper examines recent progress in medical image reconstruction, emphasizing tight frame-based methodologies. We discuss the principles, benefits, and constraints of these methods, assessing their efficacy across diverse application contexts.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 10318841\n\nTitle = Sampling inequalities affect generalization of neuroimaging-based diagnostic classifiers in psychiatry\n\nThe development of machine learning models for aiding in the diagnosis of mental disorder is recognized as a significant breakthrough in the field of psychiatry. However, clinical practice of such models remains a challenge, with poor generalizability being a major limitation.\n\nHere, we conducted a pre-registered meta-research assessment on neuroimaging-based models in the psychiatric literature, quantitatively examining global and regional sampling issues over recent decades, from a view that has been relatively underexplored. A total of 476 studies (n\u2009=\u2009118,137) were included in the current assessment. Based on these findings, we built a comprehensive 5-star rating system to quantitatively evaluate the quality of existing machine learning models for psychiatric diagnoses.\n\nA global sampling inequality in these models was revealed quantitatively (sampling Gini coefficient (G)\u2009=\u20090.81, p\u2009<\u2009.01), varying across different countries (regions) (e.g., China, G\u2009=\u20090.47; the USA, G\u2009=\u20090.58; Germany, G\u2009=\u20090.78; the UK, G\u2009=\u20090.87). Furthermore, the severity of this sampling inequality was significantly predicted by national economic levels (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2212\u20092.75, p\u2009<\u2009.001, R2adj\u2009=\u20090.40; r\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2212\u2009.84, 95% CI:\u2009\u2212\u2009.41 to\u2009\u2212\u2009.97), and was plausibly predictable for model performance, with higher sampling inequality for reporting higher classification accuracy. Further analyses showed that lack of independent testing (84.24% of models, 95% CI: 81.0\u201387.5%), improper cross-validation (51.68% of models, 95% CI: 47.2\u201356.2%), and poor technical transparency (87.8% of models, 95% CI: 84.9\u201390.8%)/availability (80.88% of models, 95% CI: 77.3\u201384.4%) are prevailing in current diagnostic classifiers despite improvements over time. Relating to these observations, model performances were found decreased in studies with independent cross-country sampling validations (all p\u2009<\u2009.001, BF10\u2009>\u200915). In light of this, we proposed a purpose-built quantitative assessment checklist, which demonstrated that the overall ratings of these models increased by publication year but were negatively associated with model performance.\n\nTogether, improving sampling economic equality and hence the quality of machine learning models may be a crucial facet to plausibly translating neuroimaging-based diagnostic classifiers into clinical practice.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12916-023-02941-4.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 11089132\n\nTitle = The role of machine learning in advancing diabetic foot: a review\n\nDiabetic foot complications impose a significant strain on healthcare systems worldwide, acting as a principal cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes mellitus.

The search strategy was carefully crafted, employing a combination of keywords such as \u201cMachine Learning,\u201d \u201cDiabetic Foot,\u201d \u201cDiabetic Foot Ulcers,\u201d \u201cDiabetic Foot Care,\u201d \u201cArtificial Intelligence,\u201d and \u201cPredictive Modeling.\u201d This review offers an in-depth analysis of the foundational principles and algorithms that constitute ML, placing a special emphasis on their relevance to the medical sciences, particularly within the specialized domain of diabetic foot pathology. Through the incorporation of illustrative case studies and schematic diagrams, the review endeavors to elucidate the intricate computational methodologies involved.\n\nML has proven to be invaluable in deriving critical insights from complex datasets, enhancing both the diagnostic precision and therapeutic planning for diabetic foot management. This review highlights the efficacy of ML in clinical decision-making, underscored by comparative analyses of ML algorithms in prognostic assessments and diagnostic applications within diabetic foot care.\n\nThe review culminates in a prospective assessment of the trajectory of ML applications in the realm of diabetic foot care. We believe that despite challenges such as computational limitations and ethical considerations, ML remains at the forefront of revolutionizing treatment paradigms for the management of diabetic foot complications that are globally applicable and precision-oriented. This technological evolution heralds unprecedented possibilities for treatment and opportunities for enhancing patient care.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 9370746\n\nTitle = Digital Innovation Enabled Nanomaterial Manufacturing; Machine Learning Strategies and Green Perspectives\n\nMachine learning has been an emerging scientific field serving the modern multidisciplinary needs in the Materials Science and Manufacturing sector. The taxonomy and mapping of nanomaterial properties based on data analytics is going to ensure safe and green manufacturing with consciousness raised on effective resource management. The utilization of predictive modelling tools empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) has proposed novel paths in materials discovery and optimization, while it can further stimulate the cutting-edge and data-driven design of a tailored behavioral profile of nanomaterials to serve the special needs of application environments. The previous knowledge of the physics and mathematical representation of material behaviors, as well as the utilization of already generated testing data, received specific attention by scientists. However, the exploration of available information is not always manageable, and machine intelligence can efficiently (computational resources, time) meet this challenge via high-throughput multidimensional search exploration capabilities. Moreover, the modelling of bio-chemical interactions with the environment and living organisms has been demonstrated to connect chemical structure with acute or tolerable effects upon exposure. Thus, in this review, a summary of recent computational developments is provided with the aim to cover excelling research and present challenges towards unbiased, decentralized, and data-driven decision-making, in relation to increased impact in the field of advanced nanomaterials manufacturing and nanoinformatics, and to indicate the steps required to realize rapid, safe, and circular-by-design nanomaterials.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n"
