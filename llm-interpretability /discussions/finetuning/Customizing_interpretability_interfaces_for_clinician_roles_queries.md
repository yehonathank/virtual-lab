## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Data Visualization Expert to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles. Include both general queries about Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles and queries that specifically relate Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Data Visualization Expert

To identify relevant literature on customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles, particularly in the context of LLM interpretability and electronic phenotype definitions, I will formulate a series of search queries. These queries will focus on general aspects of interpretability interfaces, as well as specific intersections with LLMs, phenotype definitions, clinical applications, and clinician trust. Here are the queries in Python syntax:

```python
queries = [
    "customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles",
    "LLM interpretability in clinical applications",
    "electronic phenotype definition and interpretability interfaces",
    "clinician trust in AI-driven phenotype definitions",
    "SNOMED CT integration in LLM interpretability tools"
]
```

These queries are designed to cover a broad spectrum of relevant topics, from general interface customization for clinicians to specific applications and challenges in using LLMs for electronic phenotype definitions. By exploring these areas, we aim to gather insights that will inform the development of a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
