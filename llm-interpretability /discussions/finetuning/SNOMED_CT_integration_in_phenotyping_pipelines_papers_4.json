Although extremely valuable and available to a wide research community, the heterogeneous dataset contains inconsistent medical terminology that is either aligned to several ontologies within the same category or unprocessed. To make these data useful to a research community, data cleaning, curation, and standardization are needed. Significant efforts to perform data reformatting, mapping to any selected ontologies (such as SNOMED-CT) and harmonization are required from any data user to integrate UK Biobank hospital inpatient and self-reported data, data from various registers with primary care (GP) data. The integrated clinical data would provide a more comprehensive picture of one\u2019s medical history.\n\nWe evaluated several approaches to map GP clinical Read codes to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) terminologies. The results were compared, mapping inconsistencies were flagged, a quality category was assigned to each mapping to evaluate overall mapping quality.\n\nWe propose a curation and data integration pipeline for harmonizing diagnosis. We also report challenges identified in mapping Read codes from UK Biobank GP tables to ICD and SNOMED CT.\n\nSome of the challenges\u2013the lack of precise one-to-one mapping between ontologies or the need for additional ontology to fully map terms\u2013are general reflecting trade-offs to be made at different steps. Other challenges are due to automatic mapping and can be overcome by leveraging existing mappings, supplemented with automated and manual curation.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11179014\n\nTitle = Redefining Health Care Data Interoperability: Empirical Exploration of Large Language Models in Information Exchange\n\nEfficient data exchange and health care interoperability are impeded by medical records often being in nonstandardized or unstructured natural language format. Advanced language models, such as large language models (LLMs), may help overcome current challenges in information exchange.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the capability of LLMs in transforming and transferring health care data to support interoperability.\n\nUsing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and UK Biobank, the study conducted 3 experiments. Experiment 1 assessed the accuracy of transforming structured laboratory results into unstructured format. Experiment 2 explored the conversion of diagnostic codes between the coding frameworks of the ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification), and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) using a traditional mapping table and a text-based approach facilitated by the LLM ChatGPT. Experiment 3 focused on extracting targeted information from unstructured records that included comprehensive clinical information (discharge notes).\n\nThe text-based approach showed a high conversion accuracy in transforming laboratory results (experiment 1) and an enhanced consistency in diagnostic code conversion, particularly for frequently used diagnostic names, compared with the traditional mapping approach (experiment 2). In experiment 3, the LLM showed a positive predictive value of 87.2% in extracting generic drug names.\n\nThis study highlighted the potential role of LLMs in significantly improving health care data interoperability, demonstrated by their high accuracy and efficiency in data transformation and exchange. The LLMs hold vast potential for enhancing medical data exchange without complex standardization for medical terms and data structure.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 1 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"SNOMED CT and LLM interpretability in electronic phenotyping\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 10793431\n\nTitle = Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Rare Disease Concept Normalization\n\nWe aim to develop a novel method for rare disease concept normalization by fine-tuning Llama 2, an open-source large language model (LLM), using a domain-specific corpus sourced from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO).\n\nWe developed an in-house template-based script to generate two corpora for fine-tuning. The first (NAME) contains standardized HPO names, sourced from the HPO vocabularies, along with their corresponding identifiers. The second (NAME+SYN) includes HPO names and half of the concept\u2019s synonyms as well as identifiers. Subsequently, we fine-tuned Llama2 (Llama2-7B) for each sentence set and conducted an evaluation using a range of sentence prompts and various phenotype terms.\n\nWhen the phenotype terms for normalization were included in the fine-tuning corpora, both models demonstrated nearly perfect performance, averaging over 99% accuracy. In comparison, ChatGPT-3.5 has only ~20% accuracy in identifying HPO IDs for phenotype terms. When single-character typos were introduced in the phenotype terms, the accuracy of NAME and NAME+SYN is 10.2% and 36.1%, respectively, but increases to 61.8% (NAME+SYN) with additional typo-specific fine-tuning. For terms sourced from HPO vocabularies as unseen synonyms, the NAME model achieved 11.2% accuracy, while the NAME+SYN model achieved 92.7% accuracy.\n\nOur fine-tuned models demonstrate ability to normalize phenotype terms unseen in the fine-tuning corpus, including misspellings, synonyms, terms from other ontologies, and laymen\u2019s terms. Our approach provides a solution for the use of LLM to identify named medical entities from the clinical narratives, while successfully normalizing them to standard concepts in a controlled vocabulary.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 2 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"SNOMED CT integration for phenotype definition and clinical applications\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 9147872\n\nTitle = HL7 FHIR with SNOMED-CT to Achieve Semantic and Structural Interoperability in Personal Health Data: A Proof-of-Concept Study\n\nHeterogeneity is a problem in storing and exchanging data in a digital health information system (HIS) following semantic and structural integrity. The existing literature shows different methods to overcome this problem. Fast healthcare interoperable resources (FHIR) as a structural standard may explain other information models, (e.g., personal, physiological, and behavioral data from heterogeneous sources, such as activity sensors, questionnaires, and interviews) with semantic vocabularies, (e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine\u2014Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)) to connect personal health data to an electronic health record (EHR). We design and develop an intuitive health coaching (eCoach) smartphone application to prove the concept. We combine HL7 FHIR and SNOMED-CT vocabularies to exchange personal health data in JavaScript object notion (JSON). This study explores and analyzes our attempt to design and implement a structurally and logically compatible tethered personal health record (PHR) that allows bidirectional communication with an EHR. Our eCoach prototype implements most PHR-S FM functions as an interoperability quality standard. Its end-to-end (E2E) data are protected with a TSD (Services for Sensitive Data) security mechanism. We achieve 0% data loss and 0% unreliable performances during data transfer between PHR and EHR. Furthermore, this experimental study shows the effectiveness of FHIR modular resources toward flexible management of data components in the PHR (eCoach) prototype.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11865875\n\nTitle = Digital Phenotyping of Rare Endocrine Diseases Across International Data Networks and the Effect of Granularity of Original Vocabulary\n\nRare diseases occur in <50 per 100000 people and require lifelong management. However, essential epidemiological data on such diseases are lacking, and a consecutive monitoring system across time and regions remains to be established. Standardized digital phenotypes are required to leverage an international data network for research on rare endocrine diseases. We developed digital phenotypes for rare endocrine diseases using the observational medical outcome partnership common data model.\n\nDigital phenotypes of three rare endocrine diseases (medullary thyroid cancer, hypoparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma) were validated across three databases that use different vocabularies: Severance Hospital\u2019s electronic health record from South Korea; IQVIA\u2019s United Kingdom (UK) database for general practitioners; and IQVIA\u2019s United States (US) hospital database for general hospitals. We estimated the performance of different digital phenotyping methods based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 in the UK and the US or systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms (SNOMED CT) in Korea.\n\nThe positive predictive value of digital phenotyping was higher using SNOMED CT-based phenotyping than ICD-10-based phenotyping for all three diseases in Korea (e.g., pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma: ICD-10, 58%\u201362%; SNOMED CT, 89%). Estimated incidence rates by digital phenotyping were as follows: medullary thyroid cancer, 0.34\u20132.07 (Korea), 0.13\u20130.30 (US); hypoparathyroidism, 0.40\u20131.20 (Korea), 0.59\u20131.01 (US), 0.00\u20131.78 (UK); and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, 0.95\u20131.67 (Korea), 0.35\u20130.77 (US), 0.00\u20130.49 (UK).\n\nOur findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing digital phenotyping of rare endocrine diseases and highlight the importance of implementing SNOMED CT in routine clinical practice to provide granularity for research.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 2 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Building clinician trust with SNOMED CT in phenotyping pipelines\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 10767975\n\nTitle =  The Human Phenotype Ontology in 2024: phenotypes around the world\n\nThe Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a widely used resource that comprehensively organizes and defines the phenotypic features of human disease, enabling computational inference and supporting genomic and phenotypic analyses through semantic similarity and machine learning algorithms. The HPO has widespread applications in clinical diagnostics and translational research, including genomic diagnostics, gene-disease discovery, and cohort analytics. In recent years, groups around the world have developed translations of the HPO from English to other languages, and the HPO browser has been internationalized, allowing users to view HPO term labels and in many cases synonyms and definitions in ten languages in addition to English. Since our last report, a total of 2239 new HPO terms and 49235 new HPO annotations were developed, many in collaboration with external groups in the fields of psychiatry, arthrogryposis, immunology\u00a0and cardiology. The Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) is a new effort to model treatments and other measures taken for clinical management. Finally, the HPO consortium is contributing to efforts to integrate the HPO and the GA4GH Phenopacket Schema into electronic health records (EHRs) with the goal of more standardized and computable integration of rare disease data in EHRs.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 6405506\n\nTitle = From Big Data to Precision Medicine\n\nFor over a decade the term \u201cBig data\u201d has been used to describe the rapid increase in volume, variety and velocity of information available, not just in medical research but in almost every aspect of our lives. As scientists, we now have the capacity to rapidly generate, store and analyse data that, only a few years ago, would have taken many years to compile. However, \u201cBig data\u201d no longer means what it once did. The term has expanded and now refers not to just large data volume, but to our increasing ability to analyse and interpret those data. Tautologies such as \u201cdata analytics\u201d and \u201cdata science\u201d have emerged to describe approaches to the volume of available information as it grows ever larger. New methods dedicated to improving data collection, storage, cleaning, processing and interpretation continue to be developed, although not always by, or for, medical researchers. Exploiting new tools to extract meaning from large volume information has the potential to drive real change in clinical practice, from personalized therapy and intelligent drug design to population screening and electronic health record mining. As ever, where new technology promises \u201cBig Advances,\u201d significant challenges remain. Here we discuss both the opportunities and challenges posed to biomedical research by our increasing ability to tackle large datasets. Important challenges include the need for standardization of data content, format, and clinical definitions, a heightened need for collaborative networks with sharing of both data and expertise and, perhaps most importantly, a need to reconsider how and when analytic methodology is taught to medical researchers. We also set \u201cBig data\u201d analytics in context: recent advances may appear to promise a revolution, sweeping away conventional approaches to medical science. However, their real promise lies in their synergy with, not replacement of, classical hypothesis-driven methods. The generation of novel, data-driven hypotheses based on interpretable models will always require stringent validation and experimental testing. Thus, hypothesis-generating research founded on large datasets adds to, rather than replaces, traditional hypothesis driven science. Each can benefit from the other and it is through using both that we can improve clinical practice.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nNo articles found on PubMed Central for the query \"Visual interpretability of SNOMED CT-enhanced phenotyping using LLMs\"."
