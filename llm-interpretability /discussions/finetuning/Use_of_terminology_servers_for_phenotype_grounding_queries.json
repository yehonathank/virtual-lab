        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Clinical Informatics Specialist to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.\n                You are responsible for understanding the topic Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.\n                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.\n                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding. Include both general queries about Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding and queries that specifically relate Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.\n                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Use of terminology servers for phenotype grounding (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?\n\nClinical Informatics Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

These queries are designed to cover both general aspects and specific intersections with LLM interpretability, clinical applications, and clinician trust. Here are the queries in Python syntax:\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"terminology servers AND phenotype grounding AND electronic health records\",\n    \"terminology servers AND phenotype grounding AND large language models AND interpretability\",\n    \"SNOMED CT AND phenotype definition AND clinical applications\",\n    \"terminology servers AND phenotype grounding AND clinician trust AND visual interpretability\",\n    \"phenotype grounding AND LLM interpretability AND electronic phenotype definitions\"\n]\n```\n\nThese queries aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape, focusing on how terminology servers can be utilized for phenotype grounding and how this can be integrated with LLMs to enhance interpretability and trust in clinical settings."
