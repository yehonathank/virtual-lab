        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Data Visualization Expert to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.\n                You are responsible for understanding the topic Visual analytics for clinical decision support in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.\n                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Visual analytics for clinical decision support to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.\n                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Visual analytics for clinical decision support. Include both general queries about Visual analytics for clinical decision support and queries that specifically relate Visual analytics for clinical decision support to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.\n                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the PMCIDs and titles of the papers you wish to fine-tune yourself on (as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as double-quoted string)?\n\nData Visualization Expert, please provide your response to the agenda."

Additionally, you might consider looking into related fields or keywords that could yield more results, such as \"clinical decision support systems,\" \"interpretability in AI,\" \"electronic health records,\" or \"trust in AI for healthcare.\"\n\nIf you have any other specific areas or keywords you'd like to explore, please let me know!"
