However, this has come at the expense of models becoming less understandable, limiting their application scope in high-stakes domains. The increased interest in explainability has resulted in many proposed forms of explanation. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that rationales, or language explanations, are more intuitive and human-understandable, especially for non-technical stakeholders. This survey provides an overview of the progress the community has achieved thus far in rationalization approaches for text classification. We first describe and compare techniques for producing extractive and abstractive rationales. Next, we present various rationale-annotated data sets that facilitate the training and evaluation of rationalization models. Then, we detail proxy-based and human-grounded metrics to evaluate machine-generated rationales. Finally, we outline current challenges and encourage directions for future work.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 1 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"LLM interpretability SHAP LIME electronic phenotype definition\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 10521578\n\nTitle = Machine learning in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning are driving a paradigm shift in medicine, promising data-driven, personalized solutions for managing diabetes and the excess cardiovascular risk it poses. In this comprehensive review of machine learning applications in the care of patients with diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, we offer a broad overview of various data-driven methods and how they may be leveraged in developing predictive models for personalized care. We review existing as well as expected artificial intelligence solutions in the context of diagnosis, prognostication, phenotyping, and treatment of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. In addition to discussing the key properties of such models that enable their successful application in complex risk prediction, we define challenges that arise from their misuse and the role of methodological standards in overcoming these limitations. We also identify key issues in equity and bias mitigation in healthcare and discuss how the current regulatory framework should ensure the efficacy and safety of medical artificial intelligence products in transforming cardiovascular care and outcomes in diabetes.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12933-023-01985-3.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 2 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Token-level attribution SHAP LIME clinical applications\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11213143\n\nTitle = Prospector Heads: Generalized Feature Attribution for Large Models & Data\n\nFeature attribution, the ability to localize regions of the input data that are relevant for classification, is an important capability for ML models in scientific and biomedical domains.

Prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial to improve accessibility and reduce mortality rates. Traditional diagnosis methods cannot effectively capture the complexities of these diseases due to the presence of similar symptoms. Although machine learning (ML) models offer accurate predictions, they operate as \u201cblack boxes\u201d with non-interpretable decision-making processes, making it challenging for healthcare providers to comprehend how the conclusions are reached. This study employs explainable AI (XAI) models such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT to clarify diagnostic results for healthcare workers, building trust and transparency in medical diagnostics by describing which symptoms had the greatest impact on the model\u2019s decisions and providing clear, understandable explanations. The models were implemented on Google Colab and Visual Studio Code because of their rich libraries and extensions. Results showed that the Random Forest model outperformed the other tested models; in addition, important features were identified with the LIME plots while ChatGPT 3.5 had a comparative advantage over other LLMs. The study integrates RF, LIME, and GPT in building a mobile app to enhance the interpretability and transparency in malaria and typhoid diagnosis system. Despite its promising results, the system\u2019s performance is constrained by the quality of the dataset. Additionally, while LIME and GPT improve transparency, they may introduce complexities in real-time deployment due to computational demands and the need for internet service to maintain relevance and accuracy. The findings suggest that AI-driven diagnostic systems can significantly enhance healthcare delivery in environments with limited resources, and future works can explore the applicability of this framework to other medical conditions and datasets.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11877768\n\nTitle = The role of explainable artificial intelligence in disease prediction: a systematic literature review and future research directions\n\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) enhances transparency and interpretability in AI models, which is crucial for trust and accountability in healthcare. A potential application of XAI is disease prediction using various data modalities. This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) following the PRISMA protocol, synthesizing findings from 30 selected studies to examine XAI\u2019s evolving role in disease prediction. It explores commonly used XAI methods, such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and their impact across medical fields in disease prediction. The review highlights key gaps, including limited dataset diversity, model complexity, and reliance on single data types, emphasizing the need for greater interpretability and data integration. Addressing these issues is crucial for advancing AI in healthcare. This study contributes by outlining current challenges and potential solutions, suggesting directions for future research to develop more reliable and robust XAI methods.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 11900311\n\nTitle = Shaping the Future of Healthcare: Ethical Clinical Challenges and Pathways to Trustworthy AI\n\nBackground/Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, enabling advances in diagnostics, treatment optimization, and patient care.

Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment, but traditional methods are often time-consuming and expensive. This study leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, using voice analysis to detect early signs of PD. We applied a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a dataset of 81 voice recordings. Acoustic features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), jitter, and shimmer were analyzed. The model achieved 91.11% accuracy, 92.50% recall, 89.84% precision, 91.13% F1 score, and an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.9125. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provided data explainability, identifying key features driving the PD diagnosis, thus enhancing AI interpretability and trustability. Furthermore, a probability-based scoring system was developed to enable PD patients and clinicians to track disease progression. This AI-driven approach offers a non-invasive, cost-effective, and rapid tool for early PD detection, facilitating personalized treatment through vocal biomarkers.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-96575-6.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 11765989\n\nTitle = Explainable AI in Digestive Healthcare and Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\n\nAn important impediment to the incorporation of artificial intelligence-based tools into healthcare is their association with so-called black box medicine, a concept arising due to their complexity and the difficulties in understanding how they reach a decision. This situation may compromise the clinician\u2019s trust in these tools, should any errors occur, and the inability to explain how decisions are reached may affect their relationship with patients. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to overcome this limitation by facilitating a better understanding of how AI models reach their conclusions for users, thereby enhancing trust in the decisions reached. This review first defined the concepts underlying XAI, establishing the tools available and how they can benefit digestive healthcare. Examples of the application of XAI in digestive healthcare were provided, and potential future uses were proposed. In addition, aspects of the regulatory frameworks that must be established and the ethical concerns that must be borne in mind during the development of these tools were discussed. Finally, we considered the challenges that this technology faces to ensure that optimal benefits are reaped, highlighting the need for more research into the use of XAI in this field.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nNo articles found on PubMed Central for the query \"Token-level attribution SHAP LIME phenotype definition\"."
