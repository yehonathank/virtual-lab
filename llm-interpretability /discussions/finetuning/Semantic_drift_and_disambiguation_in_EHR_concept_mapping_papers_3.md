This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Clinical Informatics Specialist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Semantic drift and disambiguation in EHR concept mapping in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Semantic drift and disambiguation in EHR concept mapping to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Semantic drift and disambiguation in EHR concept mapping. Include both general queries about Semantic drift and disambiguation in EHR concept mapping and queries that specifically relate Semantic drift and disambiguation in EHR concept mapping to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the PMCIDs and titles of the papers you wish to fine-tune yourself on (as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as double-quoted string)?

Clinical Informatics Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda.

Title = Generating synthetic mixed-type longitudinal electronic health records for artificial intelligent applications

The recent availability of electronic health records (EHRs) have provided enormous opportunities to develop artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. However, patient privacy has become a major concern that limits data sharing across hospital settings and subsequently hinders the advances in AI. Synthetic data, which benefits from the development and proliferation of generative models, has served as a promising substitute for real patient EHR data. However, the current generative models are limited as they only generate single type of clinical data for a synthetic patient, i.e., either continuous-valued or discrete-valued. To mimic the nature of clinical decision-making which encompasses various data types/sources, in this study, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) entitled EHR-M-GAN that simultaneously synthesizes mixed-type timeseries EHR data. EHR-M-GAN is capable of capturing the multidimensional, heterogeneous, and correlated temporal dynamics in patient trajectories. We have validated EHR-M-GAN on three publicly-available intensive care unit databases with records from a total of 141,488 unique patients, and performed privacy risk evaluation of the proposed model. EHR-M-GAN has demonstrated its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks for synthesizing clinical timeseries with high fidelity, while addressing the limitations regarding data types and dimensionality in the current generative models. Notably, prediction models for outcomes of intensive care performed significantly better when training data was augmented with the addition of EHR-M-GAN-generated timeseries. EHR-M-GAN may have use in developing AI algorithms in resource-limited settings, lowering the barrier for data acquisition while preserving patient privacy.

Title = Generating Synthetic Electronic Health Record Data Using Generative Adversarial Networks: Tutorial

Synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data generation has been increasingly recognized as an important solution to expand the accessibility and maximize the value of private health data on a large scale. Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated more accurate modeling for complex and high-dimensional data, thereby greatly enhancing the data quality of synthetic EHR data. Among various approaches, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become the main technical path in the literature due to their ability to capture the statistical characteristics of real data. However, there is a scarcity of detailed guidance within the domain regarding the development procedures of synthetic EHR data. The objective of this tutorial is to present a transparent and reproducible process for generating structured synthetic EHR data using a publicly accessible EHR data set as an example. We cover the topics of GAN architecture, EHR data types and representation, data preprocessing, GAN training, synthetic data generation and postprocessing, and data quality evaluation. We conclude this tutorial by discussing multiple important issues and future opportunities in this domain. The source code of the entire process has been made publicly available.

Title = Using NLP in openEHR archetypes retrieval to promote interoperability: a feasibility study in China

With the development and application of medical information system, semantic interoperability is essential for accurate and advanced health-related computing and electronic health record (EHR) information sharing. The openEHR approach can improve semantic interoperability. One key improvement of openEHR is that it allows for the use of existing archetypes. The crucial problem is how to improve the precision and resolve ambiguity in the archetype retrieval.

Based on the query expansion technology and Word2Vec model in Nature Language Processing (NLP), we propose to find synonyms as substitutes for original search terms in archetype retrieval. Test sets in different medical professional level are used to verify the feasibility.

Applying the approach to each original search term (n = 120) in test sets, a total of 69,348 substitutes were constructed. Precision at 5 (P@5) was improved by 0.767, on average. For the best result, the P@5 was up to 0.975.

We introduce a novel approach that using NLP technology and corpus to find synonyms as substitutes for original search terms. Compared to simply mapping the element contained in openEHR to an external dictionary, this approach could greatly improve precision and resolve ambiguity in retrieval tasks. This is helpful to promote the application of openEHR and advance EHR information sharing.

Title = Developing a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework: A case study for identification of patients with obesity and multiple comorbidities from discharge summaries

Standards-based clinical data normalization has become a key component of effective data integration and accurate phenotyping for secondary use of electronic healthcare records (EHR) data. HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging clinical data standard for exchanging electronic healthcare data and has been used in modeling and integrating both structured and unstructured EHR data for a variety of clinical research applications. The overall objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework for identification of patients with obesity and its multiple comorbidities from semi-structured discharge summaries leveraging a FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline (known as NLP2FHIR).

We implemented a multi-class and multi-label classification system based on the i2b2 Obesity Challenge task to evaluate the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework. Two core parts of the framework are: (a) the conversion of discharge summaries into corresponding FHIR resources – Composition, Condition, MedicationStatement, Procedure and FamilyMemberHistory using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, and (b) the implementation of four machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) to train classifiers to predict disease state of obesity and 15 comorbidities using features extracted from standard FHIR resources and terminology expansions. We used the macro- and micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score (F1) measures to evaluate the classifier performance. We validated the framework using a second obesity dataset extracted from the MIMIC-III database.

Using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, 1237 clinical discharge summaries from the 2008 i2b2 obesity challenge dataset were represented as the instances of the FHIR Composition resource consisting of 5677 records with 16 unique section types. After the NLP processing and FHIR modeling, a set of 244,438 FHIR clinical resource instances were generated. As the results of the four machine learning classifiers, the random forest algorithm performed the best with F1-micro(0.9466)/F1-macro(0.7887) and F1-micro(0.9536)/F1-macro(0.6524) for intuitive classification (reflecting medical professionals’ judgments) and textual classification (reflecting the judgments based on explicitly reported information of diseases), respectively. The MIMIC-III obesity dataset was successfully integrated for prediction with minimal configuration of the NLP2FHIR pipeline and machine learning models.

The study demonstrated that the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping approach could effectively identify the state of obesity and multiple comorbidities using semi-structured discharge summaries. Our FHIR-based phenotyping approach is a first concrete step towards improving the data aspect of phenotyping portability across EHR systems and enhancing interpretability of the machine learning-based phenotyping algorithms.

Title = Transformers and large language models in healthcare: A review

With Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating various aspects of society, including healthcare, the adoption of the Transformers neural network architecture is rapidly changing many applications. Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture initially developed to solve general-purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and has subsequently been adapted in many fields, including healthcare. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of how this architecture has been adopted to analyze various forms of healthcare data, including clinical NLP, medical imaging, structured Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, bio-physiological signals, biomolecular sequences. Furthermore, which have also include the articles that used the transformer architecture for generating surgical instructions and predicting adverse outcomes after surgeries under the umbrella of critical care. Under diverse settings, these models have been used for clinical diagnosis, report generation, data reconstruction, and drug/protein synthesis. Finally, we also discuss the benefits and limitations of using transformers in healthcare and examine issues such as computational cost, model interpretability, fairness, alignment with human values, ethical implications, and environmental impact.

Title = Processing of Short-Form Content in Clinical Narratives: Systematic Scoping Review

Clinical narratives are essential components of electronic health records. The adoption of electronic health records has increased documentation time for hospital staff, leading to the use of abbreviations and acronyms more frequently. This brevity can potentially hinder comprehension for both professionals and patients.

This review aims to provide an overview of the types of short forms found in clinical narratives, as well as the natural language processing (NLP) techniques used for their identification, expansion, and disambiguation.

In the databases Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, EBMR (Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews), and ACL Anthology, publications that met the inclusion criteria were searched according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for a systematic scoping review. Original, peer-reviewed publications focusing on short-form processing in human clinical narratives were included, covering the period from January 2018 to February 2023. Short-form types were extracted, and multidimensional research methodologies were assigned to each target objective (identification, expansion, and disambiguation). NLP study recommendations and study characteristics were systematically assigned occurrence rates for evaluation.

Out of a total of 6639 records, only 19 articles were included in the final analysis. Rule-based approaches were predominantly used for identifying short forms, while string similarity and vector representations were applied for expansion. Embeddings and deep learning approaches were used for disambiguation.

The scope and types of what constitutes a clinical short form were often not explicitly defined by the authors. This lack of definition poses challenges for reproducibility and for determining whether specific methodologies are suitable for different types of short forms. Analysis of a subset of NLP recommendations for assessing quality and reproducibility revealed only partial adherence to these recommendations. Single-character abbreviations were underrepresented in studies on clinical narrative processing, as were investigations in languages other than English. Future research should focus on these 2 areas, and each paper should include descriptions of the types of content analyzed.

Title = Automated detection of substance use information from electronic health records for a pediatric population

Substance use screening in adolescence is unstandardized and often documented in clinical notes, rather than in structured electronic health records (EHRs). The objective of this study was to integrate logic rules with state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies to detect substance use information from both structured and unstructured EHR data.

Pediatric patients (10-20 years of age) with any encounter between July 1, 2012, and October 31, 2017, were included (n = 3890 patients; 19 478 encounters). EHR data were extracted at each encounter, manually reviewed for substance use (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, opiate, any use), and coded as lifetime use, current use, or family use. Logic rules mapped structured EHR indicators to screening results. A knowledge-based NLP system and a deep learning model detected substance use information from unstructured clinical narratives. System performance was evaluated using positive predictive value, sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).

The dataset included 17 235 structured indicators and 27 141 clinical narratives. Manual review of clinical narratives captured 94.0% of positive screening results, while structured EHR data captured 22.0%. Logic rules detected screening results from structured data with 1.0 and 0.99 for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The knowledge-based system detected substance use information from clinical narratives with 0.86, 0.79, and 0.88 for AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. The deep learning model further improved detection capacity, achieving 0.88, 0.81, and 0.85 for AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. Finally, integrating predictions from structured and unstructured data achieved high detection capacity across all cases (0.96, 0.85, and 0.87 for AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively).

It is feasible to detect substance use screening and results among pediatric patients using logic rules, NLP, and machine learning technologies.

Title = Disambiguation of acronyms in clinical narratives with large language models

To assess the performance of large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot disambiguation of acronyms in clinical narratives.

Clinical narratives in English, German, and Portuguese were applied for testing the performance of four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-2-7b-chat, and Llama-2-70b-chat. For English, the anonymized Clinical Abbreviation Sense Inventory (CASI, University of Minnesota) was used. For German and Portuguese, at least 500 text spans were processed. The output of LLM models, prompted with contextual information, was analyzed to compare their acronym disambiguation capability, grouped by document-level metadata, the source language, and the LLM.

On CASI, GPT-3.5 achieved 0.91 in accuracy. GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 across all datasets, reaching 0.98 in accuracy for CASI, 0.86 and 0.65 for two German datasets, and 0.88 for Portuguese. Llama models only reached 0.73 for CASI and failed severely for German and Portuguese. Across LLMs, performance decreased from English to German and Portuguese processing languages. There was no evidence that additional document-level metadata had a significant effect.

For English clinical narratives, acronym resolution by GPT-4 can be recommended to improve readability of clinical text by patients and professionals. For German and Portuguese, better models are needed. Llama models, which are particularly interesting for processing sensitive content on premise, cannot yet be recommended for acronym resolution.

Title = Large language models for data extraction from unstructured and semi-structured electronic health records: a multiple model performance evaluation

We aimed to evaluate the performance of multiple large language models (LLMs) in data extraction from unstructured and semi-structured electronic health records.

50 synthetic medical notes in English, containing a structured and an unstructured part, were drafted and evaluated by domain experts, and subsequently used for LLM-prompting. 18 LLMs were evaluated against a baseline transformer-based model. Performance assessment comprised four entity extraction and five binary classification tasks with a total of 450 predictions for each LLM. LLM-response consistency assessment was performed over three same-prompt iterations.

Claude 3.0 Opus, Claude 3.0 Sonnet, Claude 2.0, GPT 4, Claude 2.1, Gemini Advanced, PaLM 2 chat-bison and Llama 3-70b exhibited an excellent overall accuracy >0.98 (0.995, 0.988, 0.988, 0.988, 0.986, 0.982, 0.982, and 0.982, respectively), significantly higher than the baseline RoBERTa model (0.742). Claude 2.0, Claude 2.1, Claude 3.0 Opus, PaLM 2 chat-bison, GPT 4, Claude 3.0 Sonnet and Llama 3-70b showed a marginally higher and Gemini Advanced a marginally lower multiple-run consistency than the baseline model RoBERTa (Krippendorff’s alpha value 1, 0.998, 0.996, 0.996, 0.992, 0.991, 0.989, 0.988, and 0.985, respectively).

Claude 3.0 Opus, Claude 3.0 Sonnet, Claude 2.0, GPT 4, Claude 2.1, Gemini Advanced, PaLM 2 chat bison and Llama 3-70b performed the best, exhibiting outstanding performance in both entity extraction and binary classification, with highly consistent responses over multiple same-prompt iterations. Their use could leverage data for research and unburden healthcare professionals. Real-data analyses are warranted to confirm their performance in a real-world setting.

Claude 3.0 Opus, Claude 3.0 Sonnet, Claude 2.0, GPT 4, Claude 2.1, Gemini Advanced, PaLM 2 chat-bison and Llama 3-70b seem to be able to reliably extract data from unstructured and semi-structured electronic health records. Further analyses using real data are warranted to confirm their performance in a real-world setting.

Title = Artificial Intelligence–Enabled Software Prototype to Inform Opioid Pharmacovigilance From Electronic Health Records: Development and Usability Study

The use of patient health and treatment information captured in structured and unstructured formats in computerized electronic health record (EHR) repositories could potentially augment the detection of safety signals for drug products regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Natural language processing and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide novel methodologies that could be leveraged to extract clinically useful information from EHR resources.

Our aim is to develop a novel AI-enabled software prototype to identify adverse drug event (ADE) safety signals from free-text discharge summaries in EHRs to enhance opioid drug safety and research activities at the FDA.

We developed a prototype for web-based software that leverages keyword and trigger-phrase searching with rule-based algorithms and deep learning to extract candidate ADEs for specific opioid drugs from discharge summaries in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database. The prototype uses MedSpacy components to identify relevant sections of discharge summaries and a pretrained natural language processing (NLP) model, Spark NLP for Healthcare, for named entity recognition. Fifteen FDA staff members provided feedback on the prototype’s features and functionalities.

Using the prototype, we were able to identify known, labeled, opioid-related adverse drug reactions from text in EHRs. The AI-enabled model achieved accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-scores of 0.66, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.67, respectively. FDA participants assessed the prototype as highly desirable in user satisfaction, visualizations, and in the potential to support drug safety signal detection for opioid drugs from EHR data while saving time and manual effort. Actionable design recommendations included (1) enlarging the tabs and visualizations; (2) enabling more flexibility and customizations to fit end users’ individual needs; (3) providing additional instructional resources; (4) adding multiple graph export functionality; and (5) adding project summaries.

The novel prototype uses innovative AI-based techniques to automate searching for, extracting, and analyzing clinically useful information captured in unstructured text in EHRs. It increases efficiency in harnessing real-world data for opioid drug safety and increases the usability of the data to support regulatory review while decreasing the manual research burden.

Title = Computational tools and data integration to accelerate vaccine development: challenges, opportunities, and future directions

The development of effective vaccines is crucial for combating current and emerging pathogens. Despite significant advances in the field of vaccine development there remain numerous challenges including the lack of standardized data reporting and curation practices, making it difficult to determine correlates of protection from experimental and clinical studies. Significant gaps in data and knowledge integration can hinder vaccine development which relies on a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the host immune system. In this review, we explore the current landscape of vaccine development, highlighting the computational challenges, limitations, and opportunities associated with integrating diverse data types for leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in vaccine design. We discuss the role of natural language processing, semantic integration, and causal inference in extracting valuable insights from published literature and unstructured data sources, as well as the computational modeling of immune responses. Furthermore, we highlight specific challenges associated with uncertainty quantification in vaccine development and emphasize the importance of establishing standardized data formats and ontologies to facilitate the integration and analysis of heterogeneous data. Through data harmonization and integration, the development of safe and effective vaccines can be accelerated to improve public health outcomes. Looking to the future, we highlight the need for collaborative efforts among researchers, data scientists, and public health experts to realize the full potential of AI-assisted vaccine design and streamline the vaccine development process.

Title = A mini-review on perturbation modelling across single-cell omic modalities

Recent advances in single-cell omics technology have transformed the landscape of cellular and molecular research, enriching the scope and intricacy of cellular characterisation. Perturbation modelling seeks to comprehensively grasp the effects of external influences like disease onset or molecular knock-outs or external stimulants on cellular physiology, specifically on transcription factors, signal transducers, biological pathways, and dynamic cell states. Machine and deep learning tools transform complex perturbational phenomena in algorithmically tractable tasks to formulate predictions based on various types of single-cell datasets. However, the recent surge in tools and datasets makes it challenging for experimental biologists and computational scientists to keep track of the recent advances in this rapidly expanding filed of single-cell modelling. Here, we recapitulate the main objectives of perturbation modelling and summarise novel single-cell perturbation technologies based on genetic manipulation like CRISPR or compounds, spanning across omic modalities. We then concisely review a burgeoning group of computational methods extending from classical statistical inference methodologies to various machine and deep learning architectures like shallow models or autoencoders, to biologically informed approaches based on gene regulatory networks, and to combinatorial efforts reminiscent of ensemble learning. We also discuss the rising trend of large foundational models in single-cell perturbation modelling inspired by large language models. Lastly, we critically assess the challenges that underline single-cell perturbation modelling while pointing towards relevant future perspectives like perturbation atlases, multi-omics and spatial datasets, causal machine learning for interpretability, multi-task learning for performance and explainability as well as prospects for solving interoperability and benchmarking pitfalls.

Title = Learning across diverse biomedical data modalities and cohorts: Challenges and opportunities for innovation

In healthcare, machine learning (ML) shows significant potential to augment patient care, improve population health, and streamline healthcare workflows. Realizing its full potential is, however, often hampered by concerns about data privacy, diversity in data sources, and suboptimal utilization of different data modalities. This review studies the utility of cross-cohort cross-category (C4) integration in such contexts: the process of combining information from diverse datasets distributed across distinct, secure sites. We argue that C4 approaches could pave the way for ML models that are both holistic and widely applicable. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of C4 in health care, including its present stage, potential opportunities, and associated challenges.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence offer immense potential to improve health care in the future, but a variety of real-world issues present hurdles to adoption. Data must be handled carefully to protect patient privacy. Data collected from different sources can vary in quality and completeness. Data from different assay methods (i.e., multimodal data) can be hard to combine and integrate. Here, we review and discuss methods, models, and workflows that are well suited to handling these kinds of challenges, which we argue will ensure that the promise of machine learning for health care is fully realized.

Machine learning has great potential to revolutionize health care. Yet, it is hindered by privacy concerns, varied data sources, and limited use of different types of data. Cross-cohort cross-category learning (C4) aims to overcome these obstacles by merging varied datasets. C4 involves multiple secure locations, each contributing different data types, to build comprehensive machine learning models. These models utilize data from every site, offering a broader understanding. This review explores the applications and challenges of C4 in health care.

Title = Clinical concept annotation with contextual word embedding in active transfer learning environment

The study aims to present an active learning approach that automatically extracts clinical concepts from unstructured data and classifies them into explicit categories such as Problem, Treatment, and Test while preserving high precision and recall and demonstrating the approach through experiments using i2b2 public datasets.

Initially labeled data are acquired from a lexical-based approach in sufficient amounts to perform an active learning process. A contextual word embedding similarity approach is adopted using BERT base variant models such as ClinicalBERT, DistilBERT, and SCIBERT to automatically classify the unlabeled clinical concept into explicit categories. Additionally, deep learning and large language model (LLM) are trained on acquiring label data through active learning.

Using i2b2 datasets (426 clinical notes), the lexical-based method achieved precision, recall, and F1-scores of 76%, 70%, and 73%. SCIBERT excelled in active transfer learning, yielding precision of 70.84%, recall of 77.40%, F1-score of 73.97%, and accuracy of 69.30%, surpassing counterpart models. Among deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with embeddings (BERTBase, DistilBERT, SCIBERT, ClinicalBERT) achieved training accuracies of 92–95% and testing accuracies of 89–93%. These results were higher compared to other deep learning models. Additionally, we individually evaluated these LLMs; among them, ClinicalBERT achieved the highest performance, with a training accuracy of 98.4% and a testing accuracy of 96%, outperforming the others. 

The proposed methodology enhances clinical concept extraction by integrating active learning and models like SCIBERT and CNN. It improves annotation efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, showcasing potential for clinical applications.

Title = A hybrid framework with large language models for rare disease phenotyping

Rare diseases pose significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to their low prevalence and heterogeneous clinical presentations. Unstructured clinical notes contain valuable information for identifying rare diseases, but manual curation is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. This study aims to develop a hybrid approach combining dictionary-based natural language processing (NLP) tools with large language models (LLMs) to improve rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports.

We propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to create a comprehensive rare disease vocabulary. SemEHR, a dictionary-based NLP tool, is employed to extract rare disease mentions from clinical notes. To refine the results and improve accuracy, we leverage various LLMs, including LLaMA3, Phi3-mini, and domain-specific models like OpenBioLLM and BioMistral. Different prompting strategies, such as zero-shot, few-shot, and knowledge-augmented generation, are explored to optimize the LLMs’ performance.

The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional NLP systems and standalone LLMs. LLaMA3 and Phi3-mini achieve the highest F1 scores in rare disease identification. Few-shot prompting with 1-3 examples yields the best results, while knowledge-augmented generation shows limited improvement. Notably, the approach uncovers a significant number of potential rare disease cases not documented in structured diagnostic records, highlighting its ability to identify previously unrecognized patients.

The hybrid approach combining dictionary-based NLP tools with LLMs shows great promise for improving rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, the method demonstrates superior performance and the potential to uncover hidden rare disease cases. Further research is needed to address limitations related to ontology mapping and overlapping case identification, and to integrate the approach into clinical practice for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.

Title = ChatGPT for shaping the future of dentistry: the potential of multi-modal large language model

The ChatGPT, a lite and conversational variant of Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) developed by OpenAI, is one of the milestone Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. LLMs have stirred up much interest among researchers and practitioners in their impressive skills in natural language processing tasks, which profoundly impact various fields. This paper mainly discusses the future applications of LLMs in dentistry. We introduce two primary LLM deployment methods in dentistry, including automated dental diagnosis and cross-modal dental diagnosis, and examine their potential applications. Especially, equipped with a cross-modal encoder, a single LLM can manage multi-source data and conduct advanced natural language reasoning to perform complex clinical operations. We also present cases to demonstrate the potential of a fully automatic Multi-Modal LLM AI system for dentistry clinical application. While LLMs offer significant potential benefits, the challenges, such as data privacy, data quality, and model bias, need further study. Overall, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize dental diagnosis and treatment, which indicates a promising avenue for clinical application and research in dentistry.

Title = Use of SNOMED CT in Large Language Models: Scoping Review

Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities but often struggle with knowledge-driven tasks in specialized domains such as biomedicine. Integrating biomedical knowledge sources such as SNOMED CT into LLMs may enhance their performance on biomedical tasks. However, the methodologies and effectiveness of incorporating SNOMED CT into LLMs have not been systematically reviewed.

This scoping review aims to examine how SNOMED CT is integrated into LLMs, focusing on (1) the types and components of LLMs being integrated with SNOMED CT, (2) which contents of SNOMED CT are being integrated, and (3) whether this integration improves LLM performance on NLP tasks.

Following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, we searched ACM Digital Library, ACL Anthology, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Embase for relevant studies published from 2018 to 2023. Studies were included if they incorporated SNOMED CT into LLM pipelines for natural language understanding or generation tasks. Data on LLM types, SNOMED CT integration methods, end tasks, and performance metrics were extracted and synthesized.

The review included 37 studies. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and its biomedical variants were the most commonly used LLMs. Three main approaches for integrating SNOMED CT were identified: (1) incorporating SNOMED CT into LLM inputs (28/37, 76%), primarily using concept descriptions to expand training corpora; (2) integrating SNOMED CT into additional fusion modules (5/37, 14%); and (3) using SNOMED CT as an external knowledge retriever during inference (5/37, 14%). The most frequent end task was medical concept normalization (15/37, 41%), followed by entity extraction or typing and classification. While most studies (17/19, 89%) reported performance improvements after SNOMED CT integration, only a small fraction (19/37, 51%) provided direct comparisons. The reported gains varied widely across different metrics and tasks, ranging from 0.87% to 131.66%. However, some studies showed either no improvement or a decline in certain performance metrics.

This review demonstrates diverse approaches for integrating SNOMED CT into LLMs, with a focus on using concept descriptions to enhance biomedical language understanding and generation. While the results suggest potential benefits of SNOMED CT integration, the lack of standardized evaluation methods and comprehensive performance reporting hinders definitive conclusions about its effectiveness. Future research should prioritize consistent reporting of performance comparisons and explore more sophisticated methods for incorporating SNOMED CT’s relational structure into LLMs. In addition, the biomedical NLP community should develop standardized evaluation frameworks to better assess the impact of ontology integration on LLM performance.

Title = Generative Large Language Model—Powered Conversational AI App for Personalized Risk Assessment: Case Study in COVID-19

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment. Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding, limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments. This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming.

This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data.

We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability.

Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results.

Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support.

Title = Applications of Large Language Models in the Field of Suicide Prevention: Scoping Review

Prevention of suicide is a global health priority. Approximately 800,000 individuals die by suicide yearly, and for every suicide death, there are another 20 estimated suicide attempts. Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to enhance scalable, accessible, and affordable digital services for suicide prevention and self-harm interventions. However, their use also raises clinical and ethical questions that require careful consideration.

This scoping review aims to identify emergent trends in LLM applications in the field of suicide prevention and self-harm research. In addition, it summarizes key clinical and ethical considerations relevant to this nascent area of research.

Searches were conducted in 4 databases (PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) in February 2024. Eligible studies described the application of LLMs for suicide or self-harm prevention, detection, or management. English-language peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings were included, without date restrictions. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesize study characteristics, objectives, models, data sources, proposed clinical applications, and ethical considerations. This review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) standards.

Of the 533 studies identified, 36 (6.8%) met the inclusion criteria. An additional 7 studies were identified through citation chaining, resulting in 43 studies for review. The studies showed a bifurcation of publication fields, with varying publication norms between computer science and mental health. While most of the studies (33/43, 77%) focused on identifying suicide risk, newer applications leveraging generative functions (eg, support, education, and training) are emerging. Social media was the most common source of LLM training data. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was the predominant model used, although generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) featured prominently in generative applications. Clinical LLM applications were reported in 60% (26/43) of the studies, often for suicide risk detection or as clinical assistance tools. Ethical considerations were reported in 33% (14/43) of the studies, with privacy, confidentiality, and consent strongly represented.

This evolving research area, bridging computer science and mental health, demands a multidisciplinary approach. While open access models and datasets will likely shape the field of suicide prevention, documenting their limitations and potential biases is crucial. High-quality training data are essential for refining these models and mitigating unwanted biases. Policies that address ethical concerns—particularly those related to privacy and security when using social media data—are imperative. Limitations include high variability across disciplines in how LLMs and study methodology are reported. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence signals a shift in approach, particularly in applications related to care, support, and education, such as improved crisis care and gatekeeper training methods, clinician copilot models, and improved educational practices. Ongoing human oversight—through human-in-the-loop testing or expert external validation—is essential for responsible development and use.

Title = Using Large Language Models to Retrieve Critical Data from Clinical Processes and Business Rules

Current clinical care relies heavily on complex, rule-based systems for tasks like diagnosis and treatment. However, these systems can be cumbersome and require constant updates. This study explores the potential of the large language model (LLM), LLaMA 2, to address these limitations. We tested LLaMA 2′s performance in interpreting complex clinical process models, such as Mayo Clinic Care Pathway Models (CPMs), and providing accurate clinical recommendations. LLM was trained on encoded pathways versions using DOT language, embedding them with SentenceTransformer, and then presented with hypothetical patient cases. We compared the token-level accuracy between LLM output and the ground truth by measuring both node and edge accuracy. LLaMA 2 accurately retrieved the diagnosis, suggested further evaluation, and delivered appropriate management steps, all based on the pathways. The average node accuracy across the different pathways was 0.91 (SD ± 0.045), while the average edge accuracy was 0.92 (SD ± 0.122). This study highlights the potential of LLMs for healthcare information retrieval, especially when relevant data are provided. Future research should focus on improving these models’ interpretability and their integration into existing clinical workflows.

Title = Artificial intelligence in chronic kidney disease management: a scoping review

Rationale: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem worldwide associated with cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and mortality. To effectively address this growing burden, innovative solutions to management are urgently required. We conducted a scoping review to identify key use cases in which artificial intelligence (AI) could be leveraged for improving management of CKD. Additionally, we examined the challenges faced by AI in CKD management, proposed potential solutions to overcome these barriers.

Methods: We reviewed 41 articles published between 2014-2024 which examined various AI techniques including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), unsupervised clustering, digital twin, natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) in CKD management. We focused on four areas: early detection, risk stratification and prediction, treatment recommendations and patient care and communication.

Results: We identified 41 articles published between 2014-2024 that assessed image-based DL models for early detection (n = 6), ML models for risk stratification and prediction (n = 14) and treatment recommendations (n = 4), and NLP and LLMs for patient care and communication (n = 17). Key challenges in integrating AI models into healthcare include technical issues such as data quality and access, model accuracy, and interpretability, alongside adoption barriers like workflow integration, user training, and regulatory approval.

Conclusions: There is tremendous potential of integrating AI into clinical care of CKD patients to enable early detection, prediction, and improved patient outcomes. Collaboration among healthcare providers, researchers, regulators, and industries is crucial to developing robust protocols that ensure compliance with legal standards, while minimizing risks and maintaining patient safety.
