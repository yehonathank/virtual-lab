This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Data Visualization Expert to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Visual analytics for clinical decision support in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Visual analytics for clinical decision support to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Visual analytics for clinical decision support. Include both general queries about Visual analytics for clinical decision support and queries that specifically relate Visual analytics for clinical decision support to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the PMCIDs and titles of the papers you wish to fine-tune yourself on (as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as double-quoted string)?

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your response to the agenda.

It seems that no articles were found on PubMed Central for the specific queries related to "Visual analytics for clinical decision support" and its intersections with LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust. This might be due to the specificity of the queries or the current availability of literature in this niche area.

Here are the search queries I used, formatted in Python syntax:

```python
queries = [
    "\"Visual analytics for clinical decision support\"",
    "\"Visual analytics for clinical decision support\" AND \"LLM interpretability\"",
    "\"Visual analytics for clinical decision support\" AND \"phenotype definition\"",
    "\"Visual analytics for clinical decision support\" AND \"clinical applications\"",
    "\"Visual analytics for clinical decision support\" AND \"clinician trust\""
]
```

Given the lack of results, we may need to broaden the search terms or explore other databases and resources to find relevant literature. Additionally, exploring related fields or more general terms might yield more results. If you have any other specific areas or terms you would like to explore, please let me know!
