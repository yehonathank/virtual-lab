## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Data Visualization Expert to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Visual analytics for clinical decision support in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Visual analytics for clinical decision support to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Visual analytics for clinical decision support. Include both general queries about Visual analytics for clinical decision support and queries that specifically relate Visual analytics for clinical decision support to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Visual analytics for clinical decision support (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Data Visualization Expert

To effectively gather relevant literature on Visual analytics for clinical decision support, particularly in the context of LLM interpretability and electronic phenotype definitions, I propose the following search queries. These queries are designed to cover both general aspects of visual analytics in clinical decision support and specific intersections with LLMs, phenotype definitions, and clinician trust.

```python
queries = [
    "Visual analytics for clinical decision support",
    "LLM interpretability in clinical decision support",
    "Visual analytics and electronic phenotype definition",
    "Integrating SNOMED CT with LLMs for clinical applications",
    "Building clinician trust through visual analytics in AI-driven healthcare"
]
```

These queries are structured to provide a comprehensive overview of the field, ensuring that we capture both foundational concepts and cutting-edge research that bridges visual analytics, LLM interpretability, and clinical applications.
