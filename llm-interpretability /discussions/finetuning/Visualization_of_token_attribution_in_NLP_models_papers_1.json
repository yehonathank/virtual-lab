However, this improvement comes at the expense of model explainability. Black-box models make it difficult to understand the internals of a system and the process it takes to arrive at an output. Numerical (LIME, Shapley) and visualization (saliency heatmap) explainability techniques are helpful; however, they are insufficient because they require specialized knowledge. These factors led rationalization to emerge as a more accessible explainable technique in NLP. Rationalization justifies a model's output by providing a natural language explanation (rationale). Recent improvements in natural language generation have made rationalization an attractive technique because it is intuitive, human-comprehensible, and accessible to non-technical users. Since rationalization is a relatively new field, it is disorganized. As the first survey, rationalization literature in NLP from 2007 to 2022 is analyzed. This survey presents available methods, explainable evaluations, code, and datasets used across various NLP tasks that use rationalization. Further, a new subfield in Explainable AI (XAI), namely, Rational AI (RAI), is introduced to advance the current state of rationalization. A discussion on observed insights, challenges, and future directions is provided to point to promising research opportunities.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 9839963\n\nTitle = Vision transformer-based weakly supervised histopathological image analysis of primary brain tumors\n\nDiagnosis of primary brain tumors relies heavily on histopathology. Although various computational pathology methods have been developed for automated diagnosis of primary brain tumors, they usually require neuropathologists\u2019 annotation of region of interests or selection of image patches on whole-slide images (WSI). We developed an end-to-end Vision Transformer (ViT)\u00a0\u2013 based deep learning architecture for brain tumor WSI analysis, yielding a highly interpretable deep-learning model, ViT-WSI. Based on the principle of weakly supervised machine learning, ViT-WSI accomplishes the task of major primary brain tumor type and subtype classification. Using a systematic gradient-based attribution analysis procedure, ViT-WSI can discover diagnostic histopathological features for primary brain tumors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ViT-WSI has high predictive power of inferring the status of three diagnostic glioma molecular markers, IDH1 mutation, p53 mutation, and MGMT methylation, directly from H&E-stained histopathological images, with patient level AUC scores of 0.960, 0.874, and 0.845, respectively.\n\nViT-WSI, is suitable for weakly supervised learning on histopathological images\n\nViT-WSI performs tumor typing, subtyping and molecular marker prediction\n\nViT-WSI automatically discovers brain tumor histological features\n\nPathology; Cancer; Machine learning\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 11734698\n\nTitle = GENA-LM: a family of open-source foundational DNA language models for long sequences\n\nRecent advancements in genomics, propelled by artificial intelligence, have unlocked unprecedented capabilities in interpreting genomic sequences, mitigating the need for exhaustive experimental analysis of complex, intertwined molecular processes inherent in DNA function. A significant challenge, however, resides in accurately decoding genomic sequences, which inherently involves comprehending rich contextual information dispersed across thousands of nucleotides. To address this need, we introduce GENA language model (GENA-LM), a suite of transformer-based foundational DNA language models capable of handling input lengths up to 36\u2005000 base pairs. Notably, integrating the newly developed recurrent memory mechanism allows these models to process even larger DNA segments. We provide pre-trained versions of GENA-LM, including multispecies and taxon-specific models, demonstrating their capability for fine-tuning and addressing a spectrum of complex biological tasks with modest computational demands. While language models have already achieved significant breakthroughs in protein biology, GENA-LM showcases a similarly promising potential for reshaping the landscape of genomics and multi-omics data analysis. All models are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/GENA_LM) and on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/AIRI-Institute). In addition, we provide a web service (https://dnalm.airi.net/) allowing user-friendly DNA annotation with GENA-LM models.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 9745317\n\nTitle = TSSNote-CyaPromBERT: Development of an integrated platform for highly accurate promoter prediction and visualization of Synechococcus sp. and Synechocystis sp. through a state-of-the-art natural language processing model BERT\n\nSince the introduction of the first transformer model with a unique self-attention mechanism, natural language processing (NLP) models have attained state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various tasks. As DNA is the blueprint of life, it can be viewed as an unusual language, with its characteristic lexicon and grammar. Therefore, NLP models may provide insights into the meaning of the sequential structure of DNA. In the current study, we employed and compared the performance of popular SOTA NLP models (i.e., XLNET, BERT, and a variant DNABERT trained on the human genome) to predict and analyze the promoters in freshwater cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the fastest growing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus sp. UTEX 2973. These freshwater cyanobacteria are promising hosts for phototrophically producing value-added compounds from CO2. Through a custom pipeline, promoters and non-promoters from Synechococcus elongatus sp. UTEX 2973 were used to train the model. The trained model achieved an AUROC score of 0.97 and F1 score of 0.92. During cross-validation with promoters from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the model achieved an AUROC score of 0.96 and F1 score of 0.91. To increase accessibility, we developed an integrated platform (TSSNote-CyaPromBERT) to facilitate large dataset extraction, model training, and promoter prediction from public dRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, various visualization tools have been incorporated to address the \u201cblack box\u201d issue of deep learning and feature analysis. The learning transfer ability of large language models may help identify and analyze promoter regions for newly isolated strains with similar lineages.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 10950482\n\nTitle = Insights into the inner workings of transformer models for protein function prediction\n\nWe explored how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can help to shed light into the inner workings of neural networks for protein function prediction, by extending the widely used XAI method of integrated gradients such that latent representations inside of transformer models, which were finetuned to Gene Ontology term and Enzyme Commission number prediction, can be inspected too.\n\nThe approach enabled us to identify amino acids in the sequences that the transformers pay particular attention to, and to show that these relevant sequence parts reflect expectations from biology and chemistry, both in the embedding layer and inside of the model, where we identified transformer heads with a statistically significant correspondence of attribution maps with ground truth sequence annotations (e.g. transmembrane regions, active sites) across many proteins.\n\nSource code can be accessed at https://github.com/markuswenzel/xai-proteins.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Visualization of token attribution in NLP models for LLM interpretability\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11939797\n\nTitle = Benchmarking Interpretability in Healthcare Using Pattern Discovery and Disentanglement\n\nThe healthcare industry seeks to integrate AI into clinical applications, yet understanding AI decision making remains a challenge for healthcare practitioners as these systems often function as black boxes. Our work benchmarks the Pattern Discovery and Disentanglement (PDD) system\u2019s unsupervised learning algorithm, which provides interpretable outputs and clustering results from clinical notes to aid decision making. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we process free-text clinical notes and ICD-9 codes with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Topic Modeling. The PDD algorithm discretizes numerical features into event-based features, discovers association patterns from a disentangled statistical feature value association space, and clusters clinical records. The output is an interpretable knowledge base linking knowledge, patterns, and data to support decision making. Despite being unsupervised, PDD demonstrated performance comparable to supervised deep learning models, validating its clustering ability and knowledge representation. We benchmark interpretability techniques\u2014Feature Permutation, Gradient SHAP, and Integrated Gradients\u2014on the best-performing models (in terms of F1, ROC AUC, balanced accuracy, etc.), evaluating these based on sufficiency, comprehensiveness, and sensitivity metrics. Our findings highlight the limitations of feature importance ranking and post hoc analysis for clinical diagnosis. Meanwhile, PDD\u2019s global interpretability effectively compensates for these issues, helping healthcare practitioners understand the decision-making process and providing suggestive clusters of diseases to assist their diagnosis.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11783891\n\nTitle = A survey of multilingual large language models\n\nMultilingual large language models (MLLMs) leverage advanced large language models to process and respond to queries across multiple languages, achieving significant success in polyglot tasks. Despite these breakthroughs, a comprehensive survey summarizing existing approaches and recent developments remains absent. To this end, this paper presents a unified and thorough review of the field, highlighting recent progress and emerging trends in MLLM research. The contributions of this paper are as follows. (1) Extensive survey: to our knowledge, this is the pioneering thorough review of multilingual alignment in MLLMs. (2) Unified taxonomy: we provide a unified framework to summarize the current progress in MLLMs. (3) Emerging frontiers: key emerging frontiers are identified, alongside a discussion of associated challenges. (4) Abundant resources: we collect abundant open-source resources, including relevant papers, data corpora, and leaderboards. We hope our work can provide the community quick access and spur breakthrough research in MLLMs.\n\nThe rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text. However, most LLMs are predominantly English centric, limiting their applicability in our linguistically diverse world. With over 7,000 languages spoken globally, there is a pressing need for models that can comprehend and generate text across multiple languages. Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) address this gap by processing and producing content in various languages, thereby enhancing global communication and accessibility. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of MLLMs, introducing a systematic taxonomy based on alignment strategies to deepen understanding in this field. By highlighting emerging trends and challenges, this survey aims to guide future research and development, fostering the creation of more inclusive and effective language models that cater to the diverse linguistic landscape of our world.\n\nThis survey explores the growing field of multilingual large language models (MLLMs), addressing the challenges of linguistic diversity in natural language processing.

This living systematic review examines published approaches for data extraction from reports of clinical studies.\n\nWe systematically and continually search PubMed, ACL Anthology, arXiv, OpenAlex via EPPI-Reviewer, and the dblp computer science bibliography databases. Full text screening and data extraction are conducted using a mix of open-source and commercial tools. This living review update includes publications up to August 2024 and OpenAlex content up to September 2024.\n\n117 publications are included in this review. Of these, 30 (26%) used full texts while the rest used titles and abstracts. A total of 112 (96%) publications developed classifiers for randomised controlled trials. Over 30 entities were extracted, with PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) being the most frequently extracted. Data are available from 53 (45%), and code from 49 (42%) publications. Nine (8%) implemented publicly available tools.\n\nThis living systematic review presents an overview of (semi)automated data-extraction literature of interest to different types of literature review. We identified a broad evidence base of publications describing data extraction for interventional reviews and a small number of publications extracting other study types. Between review updates, large language models emerged as a new tool for data extraction. While facilitating access to automated extraction, they showed a trend of decreasing quality of results reporting, especially quantitative results such as recall and lower reproducibility of results. Compared with the previous update, trends such as transition to relation extraction and sharing of code and datasets stayed similar.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 11880557\n\nTitle = Knowledge graph construction for intelligent cockpits based on large language models\n\nAs intelligent cockpits rapidly evolve towards \u201cproactive natural interaction,\u201d traditional rule-based user behavior inference methods are facing scalability, generalization, and accuracy bottlenecks, leading to the development and deployment of functions oriented towards pseudo-demands. Effectively capturing and representing the hidden associative knowledge in intelligent cockpits can enhance the system\u2019s understanding of user behavior and environmental contexts, thereby precisely discerning real user needs. In this context, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as an effective tool, enabling the retrieval and organization of vast amounts of information within interconnected and interpretable structures. However, rapidly and flexibly generating domain-specific KGs still poses significant challenges. To address this, this paper introduces a novel knowledge graph construction (KGC) model, GLM-TripleGen, dedicated to analyzing the states and behaviors within intelligent cockpits. This model aims to precisely mine the latent relationships between cockpit state factors and behavioral sequences, effectively addressing key challenges such as the ambiguity in entity recognition and the complexity of relationship extraction within cockpit data. To enhance the adaptability of GLM-TripleGen to the intelligent cockpit domain, this paper constructs an instruction-following dataset based on vehicle states and in-cockpit interaction behaviors, containing a large number of prompt texts paired with corresponding triple labels, to support model fine-tuning. During the fine-tuning process, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method is employed to effectively optimize model parameters, significantly reducing training costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GLM-TripleGen outperforms existing state-of-the-art KGC methods, accurately generating normalized cockpit triple units. Furthermore, GLM-TripleGen exhibits exceptional robustness and generalization ability, handling various unknown entities and relationships with minimal generalization processing.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 11623714\n\nTitle = Deciphering genomic codes using advanced NLP techniques: a scoping review\n\nThe vast and complex nature of human genomic sequencing data presents challenges for effective analysis.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are capable of automatically learning abstractions in the data that can be entirely novel and have demonstrated superior performance over classical machine learning models across a range of tasks and, therefore, serve as a promising tool for making new discoveries in psychiatry. A key concern for the wider application of DNNs is their reputation as a \u201cblack box\u201d approach\u2014i.e., they are said to lack transparency or interpretability of how input data are transformed to model outputs. In fact, several existing and emerging tools are providing improvements in interpretability. However, most reviews of interpretability for DNNs focus on theoretical and/or engineering perspectives. This article reviews approaches to DNN interpretability issues that may be relevant to their application in psychiatric research and practice. It describes a framework for understanding these methods, reviews the conceptual basis of specific methods and their potential limitations, and discusses prospects for their implementation and future directions.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 7426805\n\nTitle = Identifying and Predicting Intentional Self-Harm in Electronic Health Record Clinical Notes: Deep Learning Approach\n\nSuicide is an important public health concern in the United States and around the world. There has been significant work examining machine learning approaches to identify and predict intentional self-harm and suicide using existing data sets. With recent advances in computing, deep learning applications in health care are gaining momentum.\n\nThis study aimed to leverage the information in clinical notes using deep neural networks (DNNs) to (1) improve the identification of patients treated for intentional self-harm and (2) predict future self-harm events.\n\nWe extracted clinical text notes from electronic health records (EHRs) of 835 patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for intentional self-harm and 1670 matched controls who never had any intentional self-harm ICD codes. The data were divided into training and holdout test sets. We tested a number of algorithms on clinical notes associated with the intentional self-harm codes using the training set, including several traditional bag-of-words\u2013based models and 2 DNN models: a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory model. We also evaluated the predictive performance of the DNNs on a subset of patients who had clinical notes 1 to 6 months before the first intentional self-harm event. Finally, we evaluated the impact of a pretrained model using Word2vec (W2V) on performance.\n\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the CNN on the phenotyping task, that is, the detection of intentional self-harm in clinical notes concurrent with the events was 0.999, with an F1 score of 0.985. In the predictive task, the CNN achieved the highest performance with an AUC of 0.882 and an F1 score of 0.769. Although pretraining with W2V shortened the DNN training time, it did not improve performance.\n\nThe strong performance on the first task, namely, phenotyping based on clinical notes, suggests that such models could be used effectively for surveillance of intentional self-harm in clinical text in an EHR. The modest performance on the predictive task notwithstanding, the results using DNN models on clinical text alone are competitive with other reports in the literature using risk factors from structured EHR data.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 5391321\n\nTitle = Abstracts from the 2017 Society of General Internal Medicine Annual Meeting\n\n\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Visualization of token attribution in NLP models in clinical applications\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 10557887\n\nTitle = An interpretable deep learning framework for predicting liver metastases in postoperative colorectal cancer patients using natural language processing and clinical data integration\n\nThe significance of liver metastasis (LM) in increasing the risk of death for postoperative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients necessitates innovative approaches to predict LM.\n\nOur study presents a novel and significant contribution by developing an interpretable fusion model that effectively integrates both free\u2010text medical record data and structured laboratory data to predict LM in postoperative CRC patients.\n\nWe used a robust dataset of 1463 patients and leveraged state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to construct a two\u2010layer fusion framework that demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to single modal models.

The classifiers perform well, and the features which had statistical significance were in agreement with clinical guidelines.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12911-023-02257-6.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 7658441\n\nTitle = Illuminating the Black Box: Interpreting Deep Neural Network Models for Psychiatric Research\n\nPsychiatric research is often confronted with complex abstractions and dynamics that are not readily accessible or well-defined to our perception and measurements, making data-driven methods an appealing approach. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are capable of automatically learning abstractions in the data that can be entirely novel and have demonstrated superior performance over classical machine learning models across a range of tasks and, therefore, serve as a promising tool for making new discoveries in psychiatry. A key concern for the wider application of DNNs is their reputation as a \u201cblack box\u201d approach\u2014i.e., they are said to lack transparency or interpretability of how input data are transformed to model outputs. In fact, several existing and emerging tools are providing improvements in interpretability. However, most reviews of interpretability for DNNs focus on theoretical and/or engineering perspectives. This article reviews approaches to DNN interpretability issues that may be relevant to their application in psychiatric research and practice. It describes a framework for understanding these methods, reviews the conceptual basis of specific methods and their potential limitations, and discusses prospects for their implementation and future directions.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 11275579\n\nTitle = Four Transformer-Based Deep Learning Classifiers Embedded with an Attention U-Net-Based Lung Segmenter and Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation-Based Heatmaps for COVID-19 X-ray Scans\n\nBackground: Diagnosing lung diseases accurately is crucial for proper treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have advanced medical image processing, but challenges remain in their accurate explainability and reliability. This study combines U-Net with attention and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance lung disease segmentation and classification. We hypothesize that Attention U-Net will enhance segmentation accuracy and that ViTs will improve classification performance. The explainability methodologies will shed light on model decision-making processes, aiding in clinical acceptance. Methodology: A comparative approach was used to evaluate deep learning models for segmenting and classifying lung illnesses using chest X-rays. The Attention U-Net model is used for segmentation, and architectures consisting of four CNNs and four ViTs were investigated for classification. Methods like Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping plus plus (Grad-CAM++) and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) provide explainability by identifying crucial areas influencing model decisions. Results: The results support the conclusion that ViTs are outstanding in identifying lung disorders. Attention U-Net obtained a Dice Coefficient of 98.54% and a Jaccard Index of 97.12%. ViTs outperformed CNNs in classification tasks by 9.26%, reaching an accuracy of 98.52% with MobileViT. An 8.3% increase in accuracy was seen while moving from raw data classification to segmented image classification. Techniques like Grad-CAM++ and LRP provided insights into the decision-making processes of the models. Conclusions: This study highlights the benefits of integrating Attention U-Net and ViTs for analyzing lung diseases, demonstrating their importance in clinical settings. Emphasizing explainability clarifies deep learning processes, enhancing confidence in AI solutions and perhaps enhancing clinical acceptance for improved healthcare results.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 5391321\n\nTitle = Abstracts from the 2017 Society of General Internal Medicine Annual Meeting\n\n\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 10660543\n\nTitle = Evaluating the Efficacy of ChatGPT in Navigating the Spanish Medical Residency Entrance Examination (MIR): Promising Horizons for AI in Clinical Medicine\n\nThe rapid progress in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing has led to increasingly sophisticated large language models (LLMs) for use in healthcare. This study assesses the performance of two LLMs, the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, in passing the MIR medical examination for access to medical specialist training in Spain. Our objectives included gauging the model\u2019s overall performance, analyzing discrepancies across different medical specialties, discerning between theoretical and practical questions, estimating error proportions, and assessing the hypothetical severity of errors committed by a physician. Material and methods: We studied the 2022 Spanish MIR examination results after excluding those questions requiring image evaluations or having acknowledged errors. The remaining 182 questions were presented to the LLM GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in Spanish and English. Logistic regression models analyzed the relationships between question length, sequence, and performance. We also analyzed the 23 questions with images, using GPT-4\u2019s new image analysis capability. Results: GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, scoring 86.81% in Spanish (p < 0.001). English translations had a slightly enhanced performance. GPT-4 scored 26.1% of the questions with images in English. The results were worse when the questions were in Spanish, 13.0%, although the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.250). Among medical specialties, GPT-4 achieved a 100% correct response rate in several areas, and the Pharmacology, Critical Care, and Infectious Diseases specialties showed lower performance. The error analysis revealed that while a 13.2% error rate existed, the gravest categories, such as \u201cerror requiring intervention to sustain life\u201d and \u201cerror resulting in death\u201d, had a 0% rate. Conclusions: GPT-4 performs robustly on the Spanish MIR examination, with varying capabilities to discriminate knowledge across specialties. While the model\u2019s high success rate is commendable, understanding the error severity is critical, especially when considering AI\u2019s potential role in real-world medical practice and its implications for patient safety.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n"
