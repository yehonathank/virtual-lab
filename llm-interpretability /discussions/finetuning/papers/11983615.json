        "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) remains a critical global health challenge, necessitating robust predictive models to enable early detection and personalized interventions. This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric and systematic review of 33 years (1991-2024) of research on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications in T2DM prediction. It highlights the growing complexity of the field and identifies key trends, methodologies, and research gaps.",
        "A systematic methodology guided the literature selection process, starting with keyword identification using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and expert input. Based on these refined keywords, literature was systematically selected using PRISMA guidelines, resulting in a dataset of 2,351 articles from Web of Science and Scopus databases. Bibliometric analysis was performed on the entire selected dataset using tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix, enabling thematic clustering, co-citation analysis, and network visualization. To assess the most impactful literature, a dual-criteria methodology combining relevance and impact scores was applied. Articles were qualitatively assessed on their alignment with T2DM prediction using a four-point relevance scale and quantitatively evaluated based on citation metrics normalized within subject, journal, and publication year. Articles scoring above a predefined threshold were selected for detailed review. The selected literature spans four time periods: 1991\u20132000, 2001\u20132010, 2011\u20132020, and 2021\u20132024.",
        "The bibliometric findings reveal exponential growth in publications since 2010, with the USA and UK leading contributions, followed by emerging players like Singapore and India. Key thematic clusters include foundational ML techniques, epidemiological forecasting, predictive modelling, and clinical applications. Ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) dominate recent advancements. Literature analysis reveals that, early studies primarily used demographic and clinical variables, while recent efforts integrate genetic, lifestyle, and environmental predictors. Additionally, literature analysis highlights advances in integrating real-world datasets, emerging trends like federated learning, and explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).",
        "Future work should address gaps in generalizability, interdisciplinary T2DM prediction research, and psychosocial integration, while also focusing on clinically actionable solutions and real-world applicability to combat the growing diabetes epidemic effectively.",
        "Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease that has potentially fatal consequences if left undetected. It has the potential to lead to serious illness, such as kidney failure, sight loss and limb amputations and even fatal consequences if not detected and treated effectively. The disease has affected millions of people worldwide, and its prevalence is expected to surge in the future given that ageing and obesity are major risk factors and both are rising.",
        "Diabetes can be broadly classified into two main types, namely Type 1 Mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). T1DM is caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic cells, leading to insulin deficiency and chronic hyperglycemia, usually affecting children or teenagers. T2DM is a chronic metabolic disorder with a number of causal factors, including genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors, such as poor diet, a lack of physical activity, high blood pressure, and obesity. While both T1DM and T2DM are serious conditions requiring ongoing management, T2DM is more common and is largely preventable with early detection and lifestyle interventions.",
        "According to the latest estimates from the International Diabetes Federation, 537 million people worldwide had diabetes in 2021, and this number is projected to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045. The same report predicts that 541 million adults worldwide are at increased risk of developing T2DM. The increasing prevalence of diabetes is a major public health concern and emphasizes the need for effective and smart prediction, prevention, and management strategies.",
        "Machine learning (ML) models and artificial intelligence (AI) have great potential in developing personalized prediction systems for diabetes. Scientists have leveraged ML and data mining techniques in several research areas related to diabetes, including identifying diagnostic and predictive factors in diabetes development, predicting diabetes, analyzing diabetic complications, developing drugs and therapies for diabetes, and studying the impact of genetic and environmental factors on the onset and progression of diabetes. By analyzing vast amounts of diabetes-related data, ML models can transform raw information into invaluable knowledge, unlocking new avenues for more effective prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diabetes.",
        "In recent years, several survey articles have explored the use of ML models and AI in diabetes research. Some of these reviews have examined the application of ML tools across various diabetes-related domains. Others have taken a more targeted approach, focusing on specific areas such as diabetes detection, diabetes management, or diabetes prediction. These reviews offer valuable insights into the application of ML and AI in diabetes management and prognosis.",
        "However, with the recent surge in publications related to ML and AI in diabetes research, conducting a bibliometric analysis of the literature can provide several valuable insights, including publication trends, research hotspots, geographical distribution, collaboration networks, journal analysis, methodological trends, funding and support, thematic clusters, and gaps and opportunities. Therefore, several bibliometric studies have also been conducted in the diabetes field, focusing on various aspects and research domains. For instance, conducted a bibliometric analysis of diabetes prediction (in general) using ML algorithms. This study focused on a 12-year period (2009\u20132020), provided a snapshot of recent trends, and emphasized publication trends while identifying the leading countries and journals. Another bibliometric study examined the growth of literature in the field of diabetes (in general) by utilizing data from the MEDLINE database for the period 1995\u20132004. The study aimed to identify the core journals in this field during that time. The authors in conducted a bibliometric analysis to identify, visualize, and characterize meta-analyses on diabetic foot ulcer research, focusing on treatment approaches, risk factor analysis, and economic evaluations. This study covered publications from 1999 to 2022, with data retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database. The authors in performed a bibliometric analysis of research papers published in the field of ML and deep learning (DL) techniques applied to diabetes research (in general) from 2000 to 2022 (22 years). The articles were categorized into detection, prediction, and management. This involved the statistical analysis of published literature to identify global research trends and networks, highlighting key countries, institutions, journals, articles, citations, and research topics.",
        "Despite the valuable insights provided by these studies, several limitations highlight the need for further investigation.",
        "Firstly, many existing studies tend to focus on diabetes as a whole, without distinguishing between T1DM and T2DM. These are distinct research areas with unique pathophysiologies, management strategies, and challenges, and a broad approach often overlooks the nuanced priorities specific to each type.",
        "Secondly, the variability in the time periods covered by these studies, with some focusing on relatively short durations, limits the ability to derive comprehensive longitudinal insights into the evolution of research trends.",
        "Thirdly, while robust bibliometric techniques are applied, these studies often lack detailed analysis of thematic clusters and the methodological advancements that have occurred over time, which are critical for understanding shifts in research paradigms.",
        "Lastly, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding targeted analyses of machine learning prediction models for T2DM, as much of the focus has been on complications or broader applications of machine learning in diabetes research. These gaps highlight the need for a more focused and nuanced approach in future bibliometric analyses.",
        "To address these gaps, this research conducted a comprehensive bibliometric and literature analysis of the T2DM prediction research using ML and AI over a 33-year period (1991\u20132024). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bibliometric and literature analysis focused on the prediction of T2DM using ML and AI techniques. We offer a historical perspective and trace the evolution of research methodologies, utilizing more advanced bibliometric tools such as Bibliometrics. Specifically, the study seeks to map the intellectual structure through co-citation network analysis, identify and analyze distinct thematic clusters, assess the contributions and centrality of different ML methodologies, and highlight the foundational and applied research in the field. Our analysis delves deeper into methodological evolution, datasets utilized, most influential key features to train the ML models, and future research directions, with a particular emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches and emerging technologies.",
        "Publication trends, citation analysis, and global collaboration patterns: To analyze publication and citation trends over time, and explore international collaboration patterns and key countries\u2019 roles.",
        "Thematic clusters: To identify thematic clusters in T2DM research using ML. Summarize each cluster\u2019s focus and centrality, assess the impact of ML models on prediction accuracy.",
        "Foundational methods, datasets, and key predictors: To evaluate the foundational methods, datasets and predominant predictors used in T2DM prediction research, particularly focusing on ML algorithms and their effectiveness.",
        "Research gaps, emerging trends, and future directions: To identify research gaps and analyze emerging trends in methodologies for predicting T2DM over decades. Highlight challenges and suggest future research directions.",
        "The objectives of this study are as follows: ",
        "This study aims to evaluate the current research landscape, assess the evolution and impact of ML models in T2DM research, and identify key trends and gaps in the literature. Specifically, this study will explore the following research questions.",
        "How has the research landscape on T2DM prediction evolved in terms of publication frequency, citation metrics, and international collaborations from 1991 to 2024?",
        "How do different ML methodologies and applications contribute to the various thematic clusters within the field of T2DM prediction research, and what are the intellectual connections and centralities among these clusters as revealed by co-citation network analysis?",
        "How have ML models evolved in the prediction of T2DM, and what trends and methodologies have emerged over the different decades from 1991 to 2024 in terms of data sources, algorithms, and predictors?",
        "What are the future areas of research and associated challenges?",
        "Our research study is organized as follows: Section 2 details the comprehensive approach employed to select and analyze the keywords used in this study. The detailed bibliometric analysis by analyzing author affiliations, citation counts, publication trends, and international collaboration patterns has been presented in Section 3. The discussion on the network analysis is presented in Section 4. Section 5 analyses ML applications in predicting T2DM from 1991 to 2024, divided into four eras: 1991\u20132000, 2001\u20132010, 2011\u20132020, and 2021\u20132024. Section 6 presents future directions and Section 7 concludes our study.",
        "This section begins by outlining the comprehensive approach used to select and analyze the keywords relevant to this study, specifically addressing research question 1. Following this, research methodology employed to select the research articles based on the identified keywords is discussed.",
        "The keyword selection process began with an initial gathering of keywords, guided by input from domain experts. This input was then combined with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to identify keywords that are both relevant and comprehensive for the bibliometric research. Word clouds were used to visually represent the selected keywords. Finally, a curated set of keywords was finalised for dataset extraction.",
        "Table\u00a01a shows the initial set of keywords that were generated through the solicitation of domain expertise, encompassing both broad and specific terms relevant to T2DM and predictive modelling. The keywords were divided into primary and secondary categories based on their relevance and importance to the study. Each primary keyword was systematically combined with every secondary keyword using logical \u201cAND\u201d and \u201cOR\u201d operators to ensure comprehensive coverage and relevancy in search queries. The terms included fundamental descriptors like Diabetes mellitus and Type 2 diabetes, as well as methodological keywords such as Machine learning, Logistic Regression (LR), and Deep learning, to name a few. Furthermore, to capture various permutations of crucial terms such as \u201cprediction\u201d and \u201cpredicting,\u201d the \u201c*\u201d operator for truncation alongside root keywords has been employed.",
        "Table\u00a01b presents the refined set of articles specifically focusing on T2DM prediction using ML algorithms. This refinement process involved a careful review of the titles and abstracts of the initially identified articles. The criteria for selection were strictly based on the relevance to T2DM prediction and the application of machine learning techniques. Consequently, we identified 1,808 articles as our initial dataset of T2DM literature. By narrowing down the dataset through this rigorous screening process, we ensured that the articles included in this study were directly pertinent to our research objectives.",
        "After establishing a foundational set of keywords, further refinement was performed using the TF-IDF algorithm on the preliminary keyword screening dataset. For more details, please refer to Appendix.",
        "During this phase, we curated a set of keywords for the ultimate extraction of articles from multiple In review databases. The chosen keywords, as presented in Table\u00a01c, were selected with the overarching objectives of the literature review in mind, as outlined in the Section \u201cAims and Objectives of Study.\u201d A threshold of 0.70 was set to guide the selection process, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful keywords were included. For instance, foundational keywords such as Diabetes mellitus\u2019 and Type2 diabetes\u2019 were chosen to delineate the research domain, ensuring that the corpus reflected the specific disease focus. Acknowledging the diverse landscape of predictive analytics, we adopted an interdisciplinary strategy by integrating \u201cData mining\u201d and \u201cLogistic regression,\u201d showcasing the fusion of statistical and computational domains. Introducing \u201clearning algorithm\u201d and \u201cneural network\u201d allowed us to encompass a wide range of algorithmic methodologies, spanning from traditional statistical techniques to innovative AI methods.",
        "The predictive emphasis of the analysis was enhanced with terms like \u201cRisk factor,\u201d \u201cRisk score,\u201d \u201cRisk assessment,\u201d and \u201cPredictive Model,\u201d directing attention to literature focusing on prognostic evaluation. Interestingly, clinical terms like \u201cRisk factor\u201d and \u201cRisk score\u201d carry considerable importance, surpassing the anticipated prominence of algorithm-related terms such as \u201cMachine learning\u201d and \u201cNeural network.\u201d This indicates that while advanced algorithms are vital, the core of diabetes prediction research lies in their integration with traditional clinical assessments. \u201cRisk assessment\u201d bridges these algorithmic and clinical aspects, underscoring the importance of evaluation in utilizing predictive analytics effectively. Notably, we combined \u201cPredictive model\u201d and \u201cPrediction model,\u201d both of which had significant TF-IDF scores, into a single keyword \u201cPredict* model\u201d to streamline our search and ensure comprehensive coverage of predictive modeling research. Additionally, although terms like \u201cDiabetes dataset\u201d and \u201cDiabetes patient\u201d met the threshold criteria, they were considered too generic and therefore excluded from the final keyword set. Instead, we opted for more specific terms to ensure the precision of the literature retrieved. However, \u201cRisk prediction\u201d given its relevance and specificity, was included as a primary keyword to capture studies focused on risk prediction and assessment in diabetes.",
        "Identification: Articles were sourced from two comprehensive databases, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, to maximize coverage and minimize the exclusion of relevant studies. This broad scope reduced the risk of missing key literature due to database limitations. A finalized set of primary and secondary keywords, informed by expert input and refined through the TF-IDF method, guided the search. The refined results for the keyword sets are presented in Table\u00a01c. The search targeted articles published between 1991 and 2024, relevant to T2DM prediction using ML techniques. This process initially identified 3,245 research articles. These articles were distributed equally among the five authors for review. Each author independently assessed their assigned articles using predefined relevance criteria to ensure consistency. Any discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through group discussions, ensuring objectivity and minimizing bias. Automation tools, including the Bibliometrix package in RStudio, were employed during the eligibility phase to identify and remove duplicate records. This automation streamlined the dataset, reducing it to 2,351 full-text articles for further analysis. The last search was conducted in August 2024. Bibliometric methods, including thematic clustering and co-citation network analysis, were applied to the refined dataset. Trends were assessed across four time periods: 1991\u20132000, 2001\u20132010, 2011\u20132020, and 2021\u20132024. Predictive models, datasets, and key variables were systematically evaluated during this process.",
        "Screening: During the screening phase, irrelevant records were removed, reducing the dataset by 2,795 articles. Non-English articles, conference papers, and those unrelated to T2DM prediction were excluded. Further refinement removed records focusing on diagnosis, prevention, treatment, or complications of Type1 and gestational diabetes. 450 articles focusing on diagnosis, prevention, treatment or complications, Type1 and gestational diabetes were not included in the review.",
        "Eligibility: After the initial screening, 444 duplicate records were identified and removed using the Bibliometrix tool in RStudio. This refinement left 2,351 full-text articles, which were assessed for eligibility.",
        "Inclusion: Following the assessment, all 2,351 articles were deemed eligible and included in the research for further analysis. No articles were excluded at this stage.",
        "The process of literature selection and data collection was conducted systematically, following the PRISMA guidelines, and is detailed in the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure\u00a01). Each step taken to refine the dataset is described below: ",
        "To address research question 2 and to meet the objective of examining key attributes of diabetes prediction literature, this section presents a detailed bibliometric analysis. To visualize and map the literature database, we employed the Bibliometric package. Furthermore, the co-citation network, co-occurrence network, and collaboration network were graphically represented using the VOSViewer software. VOSViewer is a software tool used for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks. These networks can include journals, researchers, or individual publications, and can be created based on citation, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, or co-authorship relations.",
        "Analyzing citation counts, publication trends, and international collaborations provides insights into the evolution and impact of research in this field. As summarized in Table\u00a02, the study spans 1991\u20132024, includes 1,115 sources, and reports an average of 12.09 citations per article. The authors in highlighted the early 1990s as pivotal for advancements in AI and ML in healthcare, with researchers exploring these techniques for processing medical data, particularly for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. This study captures the evolution of AI and ML in diabetes management, from these early breakthroughs to recent advancements in 2024.",
        "Exponential growth in research output and its consequences: Post-2015, annual publication output surged from fewer than 50 articles in 2010 to over 450 by 2022 (Figure\u00a02a). This surge aligns with growing interdisciplinary interest, increased funding, and AI advancements in healthcare. However, a negative correlation () between publication volume and mean citations per article (Figure\u00a02b) suggests that as quantity increases, individual impact diminishes. Similar trends in AI-driven healthcare research indicate a focus on novelty over meaningful innovation, often resulting in redundant studies with incremental improvements. In T2DM prediction, frequent reuse of datasets like the UCI Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset has led to limited generalizability and reduced clinical relevance. This lack of diverse population data restricts generalizability, clinical value, and translational impact, limiting the broader applicability of these predictive models. Without greater emphasis on real-world validation, and interdisciplinary collaboration, research risks stagnating in theoretical improvements rather than delivering meaningful advancements in healthcare.",
        "Citation trends: Research saturation and diminishing impact: Despite the rapid rise in publications, the red line in Figure\u00a02a (mean citations per article) fluctuates without sustained growth, while the green line (mean citations per year) remains relatively flat. This suggests inefficiencies in knowledge dissemination, where an expanding body of research does not necessarily translate into broader scientific progress. This suggests inefficient knowledge dissemination and \u201cresearch saturation,\u201d where publication proliferation does not equate to innovation. AI-driven T2DM prediction models often emphasize technical novelty over interpretability and validation, limiting clinical applicability. High-impact studies tend to integrate diverse data, explainable AI, and real-world implementation. Addressing these gaps requires shifting research priorities from sheer publication volume to rigorously validated, clinically relevant work.",
        "Correlation matrix insights: The unequal distribution of research impact: The correlation matrix (Figure\u00a02b) reveals an uneven distribution of research influence, with a strong positive correlation () between mean citations per year and mean citations per article. This indicates that a small subset of highly cited studies disproportionately impacts the field, while most publications contribute minimally. To address this imbalance, targeted investments should focus on high-quality, interdisciplinary research that integrates longitudinal datasets, diverse patient populations, explainable AI, and clinical validation to ensure real-world relevance. Without such efforts, the current trend risks further widening the gap between research volume and meaningful scientific advancements.",
        "Implications for researchers, journals, & policymakers: These trends have significant implications for researchers, journals, and policymakers. Researchers often face mounting pressure to maintain high publication counts potentially reducing the time and resources devoted to deeper, more impactful investigations. It is also evidenced by the negative correlation between publication volume and mean citations per article. Journals, witnessing a marked influx of submissions, must strengthen peer-review standards and encourage practices such as data sharing, reproducibility, replication studies, and open-data initiatives. Policymakers and funding agencies should promote interdisciplinary collaborations and translational research to enhance the real-world impact of AI in healthcare. Encouraging global research partnerships and knowledge-sharing can facilitate the development of interoperable AI-driven health innovations. Recent bibliometric analyses highlight the growing prominence of AI in health informatics, underscoring the need for strategic investment in high-impact research that addresses emerging healthcare challenges. While numerous articles continue to appear each year, only a fraction yield novel insights, such as integrating real-world electronic health records (EHRs) or leveraging advanced deep learning architectures for precision risk stratification. Correspondingly, highly cited works in this space are often those that bridge multiple domains (e.g., endocrinology, computer science, bioinformatics) or that focus on interpretable AI to aid clinicians in practical decision-making. This underscores the broader theme that breakthrough research\u2014encompassing originality, methodological rigour, and real-world utility\u2014tends to have a more profound citation footprint and lasting impact on healthcare practice.",
        "Our bibliometric analysis offers an in-depth view of how scholarly publication volume and citation metrics have evolved over time. As illustrated in Figure\u00a02, we focused on two principal elements: the trends in citations across publication years (Figure\u00a02a), and the temporal relationships among variables\u2014including the number of articles published (No_of_Articles), the number of citable years (CitableYears), mean total citations per article (MeanTCperArt), and mean total citations per year (MeanTCperYear)\u2014using a correlation matrix heatmap (Figure\u00a02b). ",
        "In summary, while AI-driven healthcare research continues to expand, bibliometric trends highlight the need to prioritize impactful studies over sheer publication volume. Addressing dataset limitations, ensuring clinical applicability, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration are essential for meaningful progress. Insights from Figure\u00a02 underscore the imperative to recalibrate research priorities. While the increasing volume of publications reflects strong engagement, citation data reveal gaps in quality and innovation. A collective effort among researchers, journals, and funding agencies is necessary to realign incentives toward interdisciplinary, impactful, and reproducible work. By doing so, the rapidly growing body of literature can drive tangible advancements in healthcare, particularly in T2DM prevention and management.",
        "In this study, we employ a network analysis to explore the patterns of association between various countries. Figure\u00a03 shows the visual representation of the network created using VOSviewer, which facilitates the comprehensive examination and interpretation of complex datasets. This visualization allows us to discern clusters and relationships among countries, providing a foundation for deeper analysis. Table\u00a03 complements the visual insights gained from the network analysis by presenting quantitative metrics for the top five nodes within each cluster. These metrics include bridging centrality, closeness, and PageRank, which offer valuable insights into the roles and influence of individual countries within the collaboration network.",
        "Bridging centrality measures a node\u2019s role as a bridge between different parts of the network. A higher bridging centrality indicates that a country acts as a key connector or conduit through which interactions between other countries occur. Closeness centrality reflects the average distance of a node to all other nodes in the network. A country with high closeness centrality can be interpreted as having direct and short paths to other nodes, indicating a potential for swift and efficient interactions. PageRank is a measure of node importance, which considers not only the quantity of connections but also the quality, as connections from more significant nodes carry more weight. In this context, a country with a high PageRank is seen as influential within the network, likely contributing to or benefiting from robust interactions.",
        "It can be observed from Figure\u00a03 and Table\u00a03 that Cluster-1 comprised of countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, and others, demonstrating moderate levels of bridging centrality. These countries appear to act as mediators, facilitating connections between other countries in the network. However, their closeness and PageRank values were relatively lower, suggesting a more peripheral role in the broader collaboration landscape. Cluster-2 encompassed countries like Spain, Italy, Netherlands, and Singapore, among others. Italy emerged as a notable influencer within this cluster, boasting the highest PageRank score. Meanwhile, Singapore and the Netherlands exhibited significant bridging centrality, indicating their pivotal roles in linking various countries within the collaboration network. The cohesive nature of this cluster suggests a tight-knit group of countries with strong collaborative ties, potentially focusing on prediction.",
        "Cluster-3 included leading nations such as the USA, China, India, and others, each wielding considerable influence and connectivity within the collaboration network. The USA and the UK stood out with the highest PageRank values, underscoring their dominant positions in global collaboration networks. These countries play crucial roles in shaping research agendas, driving innovation, and fostering international partnerships across diverse fields. Overall, the analysis of international collaborations highlights the roles of key countries and regions, indicating a robust and interconnected global research network. Countries such as the USA and the UK continue to lead in terms of influence and collaboration, while emerging contributors like India and Singapore show the expanding geographical scope of impactful research.",
        "Foundational ML & statistical methodologies (Blue cluster): In the context of our co-citation analysis, the blue cluster represents foundational ML and statistical methodologies that are fundamental to the advancement of diabetes research. This cluster incorporates seminal works that have contributed to the development and refinement of algorithms, particularly addressing prevalent issues in data science such as imbalanced datasets, exemplified by the work of on the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Furthermore, it includes references to widely-used tools such as sci-kit-learn, which have democratized the application of ML through their ease of access and versatility. It can be observed that there is a moderate closeness centrality observed in the blue cluster. It suggests that the methodologies it encompasses are broadly relevant to a wide array of studies within diabetes research. This relevance is attributed to the universal nature of foundational ML techniques, which are applicable across various subdomains, from basic biological research to clinical applications. Such techniques are often necessary prerequisites for more advanced, specialized research and provide a common language for scientists across disciplines. However, the cluster\u2019s lower bridging centrality reveals a nuanced role. This could suggest that, although these foundational methods are widely used within individual research domains, they are less often at the forefront of interdisciplinary integrations that link disparate strands of diabetes research.",
        "Epidemiological forecasts & lifestyle interventions (Pink cluster): Encompassing a wide range of studies, the pink cluster explores epidemiological forecasts, lifestyle interventions, and the integration of digital health technologies in managing diabetes. It reflects a broader clinical and public health perspective, focusing on risk assessments [e.g., ] and the global burden of diabetes, all of which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of diabetes management and prevention. The high closeness centrality associated with the pink cluster\u2019s themes within the bibliometric network underlines the integral role these studies play in the broader scope of diabetes research. The research contained within this cluster lays the groundwork for various other domains within diabetes research, making it foundational. It offers essential insights into public health strategies, the development of clinical practices, and the formulation of healthcare policies.",
        "Application of ML in predictive modeling (Green cluster): In the green cluster of the co-citation network analysis, the central theme encapsulates the application of ML techniques to enhance the predictive modelling and analysis in diabetes research [e.g., ]. Key findings within this cluster reveal that decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), neural networks (NN), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) are particularly effective in predicting the onset of diabetes mellitus using a range of clinical and demographic data [e.g., ]. Comparative studies within the cluster suggest that the more sophisticated ML models do not always yield clinically relevant enhancements over traditional regression models. This is critical as it underscores the need for carefully considering the choice of a prediction model in practical settings. Moreover, it can be observed that the green cluster demonstrates a high closeness centrality, which indicates their significant linkage within the research network. This closeness centrality is due to the cluster\u2019s contribution to predictive health informatics, an area of heightened importance that harnesses ML techniques to foresee diabetes onset and progression. Such predictions are crucial for planning public health interventions and managing resources in healthcare systems. Moreover, the moderate bridging centrality of this cluster reveals its role in blending methodological advancements from machine learning with practical, actionable insights for clinical and epidemiological purposes.",
        "Application of ML in clinical diabetes research (Red cluster): The red cluster specifically targets the application of ML techniques for diagnosing, predicting, and managing diabetes. It includes innovative uses of algorithms for clinical data analysis aiming to enhance patient care and outcomes [e.g., ]. A notable feature of the red cluster is its high centrality from the methodological (blue), public health-oriented (pink), and epidemiological (green) research clusters. The divergence is partly due to the unique data and specialized patient information required for clinical studies, which contrasts with the population-level data prevalent in public health and epidemiology studies. Moreover, the red cluster embodies the intersection of ML with clinical medicine, a path that is often separate from the public health and foundational research trajectories due to differing methodologies, publication cultures, and terminologies. The regulatory and ethical landscape governing clinical research further contributes to this separation, as these considerations demand stringent adherence to privacy and safety standards, which may not align with the broader ML research cited by the other clusters. Additionally, clinical application research is often driven by the immediacy of patient-centred outcomes and the rapid development and deployment cycle of medical technologies, creating a focused body of literature that prioritizes efficacy and safety. This patient-centric approach is less likely to interlace with the exploratory or predictive nature of the research found in the remaining clusters. Consequently, the red cluster\u2019s progression forms a distinct branch within the research landscape, signalling a need for more concerted interdisciplinary efforts to bridge the gap and foster a more cohesive dialogue between these crucial areas of diabetes research.",
        "Bibliometric methods for network analysis have proven to be effective tools for revealing both well-established and novel research topics. In this section, we utilized co-citation network analysis, a bibliometric method, to establish intellectual connections between significant research papers and map the intellectual structure of diabetes prediction research. This method focuses on the relationship or interaction between two publications and provides an overview of publications that have been cited together in other research articles. When two or more articles are cited together more frequently in other research articles, the probability of similarity between them is higher. As illustrated in our co-citation network analysis (Figure\u00a04), there are four distinct clusters, each representing a unique aspect of the intersection between ML and diabetes studies: the blue, red, pink, and green clusters.

For instance, GANs can generate synthetic EHRs that preserve patient privacy while enhancing the diversity and size of training datasets. LLMs like GPT-4 can assist in clinical decision-making by providing personalized recommendations based on patient history and real-time data. Future research should explore the integration of generative AI with predictive models to improve their robustness, scalability, and applicability across diverse populations. Additionally, multi-modal AI approaches, integrating text, images, and structured health records, could enhance prediction accuracy and provide a more holistic understanding of diabetes progression. However, ethical considerations, such as ensuring data authenticity and mitigating bias in generated data, must be addressed to fully realize the potential of generative AI in T2DM management.",
        "Enhancing pointwise reliability: Beyond overall model accuracy, an equally crucial aspect is pointwise reliability, which refers to assessing the trustworthiness of each individual prediction before it is used in clinical decision-making. Ensuring pointwise reliability is essential for integrating ML models into real-world healthcare settings, where incorrect predictions can have significant consequences. To enhance pointwise reliability, uncertainty quantification techniques should be employed. Bayesian neural networks, for example, estimate uncertainty by treating model parameters as probability distributions rather than fixed values, while conformal prediction provides mathematically rigorous confidence intervals for individual predictions. Additionally, ML models often produce probability estimates that may not align with real-world likelihoods. Therefore, calibration techniques, such as Platt scaling, isotonic regression, and temperature scaling, should be explored to adjust model outputs and improve their interpretability. Another approach to enhancing reliability is the computation of trust scores, which measure how similar a given patient\u2019s data is to the training distribution, helping clinicians gauge confidence in each prediction. Future research should focus on enhancing AI-driven healthcare solutions by integrating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection with a human-in-the-loop approach and developing clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that incorporate confidence scores and reliability indicators. This will enable the identification of novel or unexpected data, ensure expert intervention for uncertain predictions, and provide clinically actionable insights with measurable confidence.",
        "Building on the insights from this comprehensive analysis, several future directions are proposed to further advance the field of T2DM prediction research: ",
        "This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric and literature analysis of ML and AI applications in T2DM prediction over a 33-year period (1991\u20132024). By analyzing publication trends, thematic clusters, research methodologies, and emerging technologies, we highlight the transformative impact of AI-driven predictive modeling in diabetes research. Our findings indicate a significant shift in research focus, from traditional statistical models in the 1990s to sophisticated ensemble learning and deep learning techniques in recent years. The exponential growth in publications, particularly post-2010, underscores the increasing interest and technological advancements in this domain. However, despite these advancements, several challenges persist. The reliance on a limited number of datasets, lack of model generalizability across diverse populations, and insufficient integration of psychosocial and lifestyle factors hinder the full potential of AI in clinical applications. Moreover, while ML models have shown promising accuracy in T2DM prediction, their adoption in real-world clinical settings remains limited. The increasing use of explainability tools, such as SHAP and LIME, represents a step forward in bridging the gap between AI-driven predictions and clinical decision-making. However, ensuring model interpretability, ethical considerations, and patient-centric outcomes will be crucial for widespread adoption. Future research should prioritize interdisciplinary collaborations, integrating insights from epidemiology, genetics, lifestyle sciences, and computational intelligence. Additionally, efforts should be directed towards developing clinically actionable AI models that enhance early detection, personalized interventions, and ultimately, improved patient outcomes. Addressing these gaps will pave the way for a more effective and equitable application of AI in diabetes prevention and management. By systematically mapping the evolution of ML in T2DM prediction, this study serves as a foundational resource for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. As AI continues to advance, a collaborative, data-driven, and patient-centered approach will be essential in mitigating the global burden of diabetes and improving healthcare outcomes."
