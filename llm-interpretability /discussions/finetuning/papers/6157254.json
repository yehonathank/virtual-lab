        " Background ",
        "Practice-based research is not uncommon in healthcare. In fact, the way nurses and doctors train is through extensive and intensive practice [1]. In other words, practice-based research has been used to gain new knowledge partly by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice [2]. Practice based research networks have also been gaining on importance in healthcare as ways of addressing research questions informed by practicing clinicians. They aim to gather data and improve existing practices of primary care [3], practice-based research is not only about gaining new knowledge via practice and improving existing practices.",
        " Objective ",
        "In this presentation/paper I explain and highlight the role of practice-based research as an instrument for educational innovation in healthcare sciences.",
        " Methods ",
        "I used interview excerpts and examples of projects related to healthcare at different universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands and Germany (also known as polytechnics in Portugal) to advance the role of practice-based research in educational innovation. This type of research is an integral part of teaching and curricular assignments in the healthcare settings in the Netherlands and Germany, and particularly at universities of applied sciences. I emphasized how practice-based research can improve and enrich the curricula, while at the same time, building necessary skills of future healthcare professionals and improving practices in already existing healthcare institutions.",
        " Results ",
        "I show that practice-based research is in fact short term problem-oriented research which serves educational purposes by upgrading students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 skills and knowledge of the profession and dynamics in the work environment; which also has the potential to improve company products or design solutions and at the same time contribute to local and regional innovation in professions and profession related institutions [4-5]. Its role is multidimensional and dialectic insofar it serves multitude goals and is accomplished in dialogue among relevant stakeholders [6]. Practical suggestions for healthcare educators and practitioners in designing their curricula to incorporate the basic elements of this practice-based research are also offered in this presentation/paper.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Practice-based research is more than knowledge acquisition via practice. Its role and goals expand to enriching educational curricula with a more comprehensive engagement of external and professional stakeholders, at the same time contributing to student soft and professional skill development and solving stakeholder problems or optimizing services and products at local or regional levels.",

        "\u201cDo not you think your grandmother has sex? What happens with old gays? Why does a kiss between two elders tenderizes us and we do not think it is erotic\u201d (interview, Ricardo Iacub, 2018). It still impacts us, and what do we do with it? Do we let it pass? Do we encourage them?",
        "Throughout the centuries, sex has been postulated as the impulse that gives life to people. This word, of Latin origin, has always aroused much interest in society and in all stages of life; but it must be differentiated from \u201csexuality\u201d, because it contemplates various aspects among which it is found; sex, identities and gender roles, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy, reproduction and sexual orientation [1-6]. Sexuality is a vital dimension that is present in all stages of life, at least since adolescence. It contributes significantly to health and quality of life and is, moreover, a right recognized by international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) [4, 7-9]. Despite this, old age has traditionally been considered as a stage in which sexual needs would be absent, in which people are no longer interested or have the capacity to lead an active sexual life [3-8, 11]. Master and Johnson, two famous American sexologists, argued that older people should fight against a false belief, which considers that \u201csexual incompetence is a natural component of the aging process\u201d. This belief limits access to sexuality due to fear of failure, to consider that it is no longer correct, that it can be sick or perverse. The same authors pointed out that many of their patients had gone to priests, rabbis, doctors or psychologists and that they had received the answer \u201cit is logical at their age\u201d [3, 7, 10]",
        "The studies carried out, in our country and internationally, show that the majority of the elderly, and especially those who have a partner, are still sexually active until very old ages [6-9]. The keys to continue carrying and enjoying a quality sexual life in old age should be recognized and admitted at a social level, and among others, we should start; to be free of prejudices and stereotypes that condemn the elderly to lack of desire, or that associate sexuality in old age to something dirty or morally condemnable. Stop associating youth and sexuality. Do not assume the possible problems or difficulties that may appear as irreversible barriers. Age influences the decrease in sexual activity and interest, but not in satisfaction. It is demonstrated that sex and sexuality play an important role in healthy and full aging [1-3, 6-9, 11]. Taking into account these premises, throughout the presentation will present the results of a study conducted in the Canary Islands among people over 65 years, users of senior centers whose main objective was; obtain data on sexual activity, sexuality and whether age-related pathologies have affected their sexual relations. Against these prejudices, older adults need, want and seek some kind of loving exchange; \u201cOld people want and need to talk about sex\u201d, and also young people need to think that we have a lifetime to continue enjoying and experimenting with our sexuality.",

        " Background ",
        "Frail older adults are more susceptible to falls, fractures, disability, dependency, hospitalization and institutionalization [1]. Physical and cognitive decline, associated with frailty, potentiate the development of geriatric syndromes and lead to a decrease in self-care, depressive vulnerability and a decrease in quality of life [2]. Adapted physical exercise and cognitive stimulation allow the maintenance of physical and cognitive capacities, which is reflected in an improvement on the functional status of the elderly and in a reduction of associated comorbidities [3].",
        " Objective ",
        "To promote independent living in frail older adults by improving cognition and gait ability and using assistive products.",
        " Methods ",
        "It is planned to develop a combined intervention that will be composed by a digital cognitive stimulation program and an adapted physical exercise program. It is also being developed an auto-blocking kit mechanism for rolling walkers as an assistive product that could be used during the physical exercise program. A randomized-controlled trial will be developed to test the efficacy of the combined intervention in frail older adults. At the same time, a web platform will be developed and it will be used as a repository, providing digital intervention\u2019 materials and results.",
        " Results ",
        "Through the implementation of a multidisciplinary strategy, significant benefits are expected in the prevention and maintenance of physical and cognitive decline of the frail older adults. It is hoped that for frail older adults the combined intervention and its digital components would be synonymous of autonomy and improvement of their quality of life, contributing to active aging. The project, being based and tested in clinical practice, will guide health professionals, caregivers and general public to promote the independence of this population.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Cognitive interventions and physical exercise have impact on cognitive decline, a condition that assumes more importance once it is related with frailty in older adults. This multidisciplinary strategy gives the opportunity to older adults to act actively in their health through the spontaneous performance of cognitive and physical exercises available on the web platform. The components of the combined intervention will allow better reintegration of this population into society of today\u2019s world. By promoting research policies among educational institutions and health service delivery institutions, the MIND & GAIT project will make health care available to the frail elderly population more accessible to professionals, caregivers and general public.",

        " Background ",
        "Despite the overall increase in living standards and the introduction of universal health systems, many studies have identified persistent inequalities in all industrialized countries. The Southern European countries, namely Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, although the reforms of the 1970s and 1980s introduced universal national health services, social inequalities in health only became a critical issue in the late 1990s. However, the issue of health inequalities became a priority from 2010-2011, when (although with different degrees of severity) the four countries began to feel the first effects of the financial crisis. Various studies have identified the impact of the economic crisis on the most vulnerable population groups, with increasing rates of mental health disorders and a rise in suicides.",
        " Objective ",
        "After a brief contextualization of the welfare state in southern European countries and a characterization of health systems in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, the main health inequalities are described, identifying the potential inequity induced by the reform processes undertaken and the current austerity policies implemented.",
        " Methods ",
        "The study resulted from a non-systematic literature review, based on the Scoping review proposal. A total of 74 publications were analysed.",
        " Results and Discussion ",
        "The analysis has highlighted common characteristics and trends in the Southern European health systems, as well as some significant differences between them. In the four countries, the social gradient (particularly in education, income, and work status) is the principal determinant factor in health inequalities. Another key aspect is the steady increase in out-of-pocket spending in health as a percentage of total health spending in all four countries, markedly in Greece and Portugal. The analysis has identified potential inequalities induced by the reform processes, as result of new relations between the public and private sectors in services provision. Another example of how health systems produce inequalities is the rising proportion of users\u2019 health expenses covered by co-payments and user fees. Geographic inequality in health is another critical issue, observed in all four Southern European countries. Finally, the recent debate in the international literature on the relationship between different welfare state regimes and health inequalities will be discussed.",

        " Background ",
        "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent disease worldwide which is asymptomatic in about 44% of patients being critical to search for new ways of early diagnosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that the etiology of this disease may be associated with alterations in the function of the carotid body (CB), a chemosensor organ located within the bifurcation of the carotid artery. In animal models of metabolic syndrome, it was observed that the CBs are overactivated, underlying diseases such as obesity, hypertension and T2DM. This discovery provided a new paradigm in the neuroendocrinology field, suggesting that diagnostic function of the CBs has predictive value for the development of metabolic diseases. Despite this fact, it is not common in clinical practice to look at the CBs as organs associated with endocrine dysfunction and we believe this is probably due to the nonexistence of a user-friendly, portable medical device that diagnosis the function of the CBs.",
        " Objective ",
        "The general aim of this work is to develop a novel device that evaluates the function of the carotid bodies - a CBmeter. We are also developing a standard test meal to be used as a physiological dynamic test during CBmeter utilization.",
        " Methods ",
        "This medical device will synchronously assess several physiological variables: heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure variation, arterial pulse oximetry and circulating glucose, as well as the physiological responses to hyperoxia and meal ingestion. The results obtained will be analyzed using MatLab, in order to develop an algorithm with predictive value for early diagnosis of metabolic diseases. We are also developing a standard test mixed- meal to assess post-prandial glucose excursions with the CBmeter. The work is currently in the prototype development phase.",
        " Results ",
        "A preliminary pilot-test performed with the prototype revealed that all the proposed variables are assessable with the CBmeter. The standardized test meal used in the pilot-test caused a glucose excursion curve that stabilized 30 minutes after ingestion, being suitable for metabolic evaluation with the CBmeter. Interstitial glucose variation was 16.6mg/dl glucose with a latency time of 21min. Heart rate did not vary significantly after the meal ingestion.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The CBmeter prototype is currently optimized to be used in a medical device clinical-trial with healthy volunteers. The mixed meal developed has proven to be suited in healthy volunteers to determine variations in CB-related cardiorespiratory parameters.",

When the perpetrator's and the victim's profession were different (9\u201350%), the abuse occurred more frequently from nursing technician-to-registered nurse (3\u201333%). The presence of the doctor was identified in at least one situation of abuse occurred in the emergency units studied and was directed to a nursing technician. There was no report of verbal abuse perpetrated by other professionals of the nonmedical team and who did not participate in the nursing team.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Our study showed that in almost all instances verbal abuse occurred among the nursing staff professionals themselves. Organizational policies and strategies focusing on violence contributors factors in health care teams need to be structured to prevent violence among professionals, representing a challenge to health management.",

        "In contemporary society, ageing is a phenomenon that marks all developed societies. Portugal is one of the most aged countries in Europe. Currently, Portugal shows a life expectancy at birth of 81.3 years, an average value in terms of EU [1]. Social representations allow access to lay forms of thought, fundamental for understanding social phenomena and their consequences, and for the construction of scientific knowledge itself [2]. The Social Representations conduct \u201cthe behaviors and the practices and, in this way, justify the positions taken and the behaviors\u201d [3]. Analyzing the social representations of violence on the elderly, from the current and past conceptions and daily practices of the elderly, allows us to have access to the dominant constructions in society about the social phenomenon that is violence and the way it is socially and individually expressed by its main actors.",

Factors with eigenvalues of at least 1.0 were retained and a varimax rotation was used to produce interpretable factors. A binary regression analysis was performed using the forward stepwise (conditional) technique to identify the most significant components explaining fall occurrence. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to assess the discriminative ability of the logistic model.",
        " Results ",
        "Three principal components were identified. In component 1, the dominant variables concerned physical and cognitive fit (6MWT, Gait Scale, FAB, MMSE, TUG), in component 2 dominant variables concerned health and environmental conditions (FBM %, EH, HC), whereas in component 3, the dominant variable concerned alertness (ESS). These components explained cumulatively 37%, 56% and 70% of the variance in fall occurrence. Logistic regression selected components 1 (OR: 0.527; 95% CI: 0.328\u20130.845) and 2 (OR: 1.614; 95% CI: 1.050\u20132.482) as predictive of falls. The cut-off level yielding the maximal sensitivity and specificity for predicting fall occurrence was set as 0.206 (specificity = 72.7%, sensitivity = 47.7%, and the area of the ROC curve was computed as 0.660 (95% CI: 0.564-0.756).",

FF was assessed by the Senior Fitness Test Battery [2]. A composite Z-score was created based on the individual scores for each fitness item. CP was assessed by the Mini-mental State Examination adapted for the Portuguese population [3]. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all outcome measurements and comparisons were performed using independent sample t-Tests. Multiple regression analyses were performed to test associations between FF and CP.",

No differences were observed between these independent fallers and non-fallers sample. Multiple regression analyses were performed to understand the association of FF with CP in fallers and non-fallers. Agility was negatively associated with the MMSE score in fallers and non-fallers; however, after adjusting for gender, age and education, this association was not significant for non-fallers (p < 0.05). Lower body strength showed positive associations (p < 0.05) with the MMSE score exclusively in non-fallers, regardless the adjustments. Likewise, the upper body strength was positively associated with the MMSE score (p < 0.05) in non-fallers after adjusting for age, gender and education (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the upper body flexibility showed negative associations with the MMSE score (p < 0.05) however this association did not remain significant after adjusting for gender, age and education.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Independent older adults with higher agility scores were more likely to have an improved CP, whether they are fallers or non-fallers. Body strength, particularly improved lower body strength, is associated with higher CP in non-faller older adults, independently of age, gender and education. This exploratory study increases the spectrum of research in multimodal programs by suggesting that agility and strength training should be included in exercise prescription for fall prevention, in order to foment CP.",

        " Background ",
        "Falls in the elderly are a serious health problem and the result of the complex interaction between individual and environmental risk factors. Balance is considered a key factor for higher falling risk in this population [1, 2]; thus, assessment and preventive/rehabilitation programs targeting the balance control system are currently a clinical guideline [1]. Programs commonly include strength/power training of the lower limbs and trunk muscles and postural control exercises [1, 3]. Recently it has been shown that the elderly reach premature muscle fatigue during upright stance tasks [2], and that fatigue leads to poor balance control [4]. Muscular endurance hence appears to play an important role in the efficiency of the balance control system, particularly during performance of long lasting functional tasks. However, the association between muscle endurance and balance control measures has been overlooked, especially in the trunk muscles, despite its potential to assist clinicians and researchers to comprehensively screen falling risk factors and tailoring interventions accordingly.",
        " Objective ",
        "The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the association between endurance of the trunk extensor muscles and the risk of falls in the elderly, considering possible co-factors such as age and BMI.",

        "Community-dwelling adults \u2265 65 years were recruited from senior universities in the Centre region of Portugal. Exclusion criteria included severe physical/cognitive limitations that would prevent subjects from performing the testing protocol. Falling risk/balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS, score 0\u201356). Muscle performance was measured through the trunk extensor endurance test (in seconds). Simple and multiple linear regression analyses, using SPSS (v20), were conducted to predict the effects of muscle endurance, BMI and age on balance control. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.",
        " Results ",
        "Fifty-nine volunteers (44 females, age = 71 \u00b1 5 years, height = 1.60 \u00b1 0.09 m, mass = 71.67 \u00b1 14.35 kg, BMI = 28.02 \u00b1 4.62 kg/m2) were included in the study. The largest correlation was found between the BBS score, and muscle endurance (\u03c1 = 0.379), and BMI (\u03c1 = -0.335). Muscle endurance predicted 7% of the BBS score (r2a = 0.070, p = 0.024). When combined with BMI, muscle endurance accounted for ~16% (r2a=0.162, p = 0.003) of the total variance of the BBS score. Unsurprisingly, when age was added to the previous model the predictive capacity increased, reaching ~21% (r2a = 0.214, p = 0.01).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Endurance of the trunk extensor muscles and BMI predicted approximately 16% of the BBS score.

        "Data were grouped into three birth cohorts: born between 1990 and 1993, born between 1994 and 1995 and born between 2001 and 2004. It was found that those born between 2001 and 2004 were those that presented the highest levels of protection against measles, less than 2% of these individuals had levels of protection below the 150 mIU /ml. The cohort born between 1994 and 1995 was the one that presented the lowest protection against the disease, in which more than 50% of the individuals were below the protection threshold (150 mIU/ml). The cohort born between 1990 and 1993 is an intermediate cohort, where more than 50% of individuals are above protection threshold, but with a significant percentage of seronegative individuals. ANOVA analysis and Tukey's multiple comparison analysis showed a statistically significant difference among the 3 birth cohorts (p < 0.001). The use of mathematical modelling showed that at the end of 9 years, after individuals have received MMR II, more than 95% individuals no longer presented specific IgG antibodies against measles virus (Anti-Measles-IgG) above 150 mUI/ml (p < 0.0001).",

        "Semantic and pragmatic skills are developed throughout life and are essential in the development of school and social learning. Upon entering school, learning to read and write is developed in two large areas of knowledge. The first implies capacities of recognition and decoding of written symbols of the word and vocabulary development and the second allows the understanding of what is read through inferential capacities and non-literal interpretation. Often, students with reading comprehension difficulties go unnoticed. It is easier to detect a child who reads slowly, syllable by syllable, or with mistakes than those who read fluently but without understanding the content. These difficulties only become evident when questions are asked about the text and when it is necessary to understand the questions of subjects such as mathematics or science. Thus, success to reach the National Curricular Plan can be compromised.",

        "Material was developed to evaluate semantic and pragmatic skills in school-aged children. In semantics, aspects of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations (lexical field, synonymy and antonyms) and paronymy are evaluated. In pragmatics, competences are evaluated such as inferences, comprehension of idioms and proverbs. This material will be placed on a platform that can be consulted and used by different professionals working with children.

Balance was assessed with the BESTest, Mini-BESTest and Brief-BESTest, functionality with the 5STS [9], gait speed with the 10MWT [10], PA with the Brief-PA questionnaire [11] and HRQoL with the WHOQoL-Bref [12]. Descriptive statistics was used to characterize the sample. Correlations were explored with the Spearman correlation coefficient. By convention, the interpreting size of a correlation coefficient was negligible (0.00-0.30), low (0.30-0.50), moderate (0.50-0.70), high (0.70-0.90) and very high (0.90-1.00) correlation [13].",
        " Results ",
        "One hundred and eighteen older people living in the community (76.2 \u00b1 8.9 years; n = 79, 66.9% female) participated in this study. On average participants were overweight, with high body mass index (male: 26.9 \u00b1 4.2 kg/m2; female: 26.8 \u00b1 4.3 kg/m2) and fat-free mass (male: 29.5 \u00b1 6.3 %; female: 37.6 \u00b1 6.2%). BESTest, Brief-BESTest and Mini-BESTest were I) low and negatively correlated with intense (-0.34; -0.37; -0.32, respectively) and moderate (-0.37; -0.37; -0.35, respectively) PA; II) moderate and negatively correlated with the 5STS (-0.51; -0.61; -0.59, respectively); III) moderate to high and negatively correlated with the 10MWT (-0.69; -0.77; -0.78) and IV) negligible to moderate and positively correlated with the WHOQoL-Bref domains (I-Physical health 0.46; 0.57; 0.53; II-Psychological 0.47; 0.52; 0.53; III-Social relationships 0.32; 0.36; 0.28; IV-Environment 0.46; 0.51; 0.46).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This study shows that there is a relationship between the BESTest and its short versions with functionality, gait speed and HRQoL in community-dwelling older people. Higher correlations were found in the short versions, especially with functionality measures. This is useful for clinical practice since these versions are simpler, require less material and are quicker to apply.",

Nevertheless, this is challenging as AECOPD diagnosis/monitoring relies exclusively on patients\u2019 reports of symptoms worsening [2]. AECOPD are characterised by an increased airway inflammation and obstruction, abnormal bronchial mucus and air trapping, which results in changes in lung acoustics [2,3]. Thus, changes in respiratory mechanics related with AECOPD may be successfully monitored by respiratory sounds, namely adventitious respiratory sounds (ARS, crackles and wheezes) [3]. Nevertheless, little is known on ARS changes during the time course of AECOPD.",

ARS at anterior and posterior right/left chest were simultaneously recorded at hospital presentation (T1) and at weeks 3 (T3) and 8 (T8). ARS (no. of crackles and wheeze occupation rate\u2013%Wh) were processed, per respiratory phase, using validated algorithms [4,5].

Inspiratory crackles seem to persist until 15 days after the exacerbations (i.e., approximate time needed to resolve AECOPD [6]) whilst inspiratory %Wh significantly decreased after this period. This information may allow further advances in the monitoring of patients with COPD across all clinical and non-clinical settings, as respiratory sounds are simple, non-invasive population-specific and available by nearly universally means.

About 79% of these subjects have heard about wearables for sport, but 65% never used them during exercise. At the time of the inquiries, 24% still used and 11% gave up using it mainly because of lack of interest or because the devices did not work well underwater. Among the non-users, most reported that they did not have the opportunity (53%), considering that they are not useful (17%), or complaining about the financial cost (15%). However, most of them (74%) would be interested in trying this type of equipment during aquatic activities. Interestingly, 71% did not consider doing more exercise after they have the equipment. From those subjects using wearables, only a few (n = 24) used during in-water exercise.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "For future, the devices should be more comfortable, be more reliable, be water resistant, with longer battery life. Besides the usual feedbacks provided, they also would like to see some technical corrections evidenced by that technology. People seemed to know about the existence of wearables to monitor physical activity but are still reluctant because of their underwater reliability, cost, and opportunity to try them. These results evidenced a need for improving these technological devices according to subjects needs and the activities performed. Some suggestions were made according to the future development of these devices to use during in-water exercitation.",

        " Background ",
        "It has been recognized the central role of caregiver eating messages - restriction of food intake and pressures to eat - on later individual's eating behaviour, body image and weight status [1-3]. Additionally, shame is a painful emotion [4] also associated with the development and maintenance of body image and eating-related difficulties [5, 6], namely inflexible eating and concerns and maladaptive attitudes regarding body weight and shape [7].",
        " Objective ",
        "The main aim of the present study was to test whether recalling caregiver eating messages [3] moderates the association of external shame [8] with inflexible eating rules [7] and with concerns and maladaptive attitudes regarding body weight and shape [9,10].",
        " Methods ",
        "The sample comprised 479 Portuguese women, aged between 18 and 60 (M = 25.66; SD = 8.50), who completed validated self-report measures. The relationship between the study variables was accessed by Pearson product-moment correlation and the moderator effect was tested through path analysis.",
        " Results ",
        "Results revealed that caregiver restrictive/critical messages played a significant moderator effect on the relationships of external shame with inflexible eating rules, and with concerns and maladaptive attitudes regarding body weight and shape. These findings suggested that caregiver restrictive/critical eating messages exacerbated the impact of shame on these psychopathological outcomes, with the tested model accounting for 17% and 29% of the variance of inflexible eating rules and body weight and shape concerns, respectively. In addition, pressure to eat caregiver messages was not correlated with all variables examined. A graphical representation of the moderation analyses allowed to understand that, for the same levels of external shame, women who recall more caregiver restrictive/critical eating messages tend to adopt more inflexible eating rules and present greater concerns and maladaptive attitudes regarding body weight and shape.",

The analysis of relevance of the articles, the extraction and synthesis of data was performed by two independent reviewers. The search strategy included all articles published until November 2017, written in Portuguese, Spanish, French and English.",
        " Results ",
        "An initial total of 2,052 articles derived from the search conducted. Through Endnote software, 998 duplicates were removed. The remaining 1,054 articles were screened by title and abstract. Of these, 33 articles were included for full-text analysis by two independent reviewers. During this process, the reference lists of all included articles were screened, which resulted in the inclusion of 3 new articles. Ten studies were excluded due to absence of microbiological data inclusion and 6 were excluded due to lack of full-text access and author's reply. Overall, a total of 1,337 tourniquets belonging to nurses, nursing assistants, doctors, phlebotomists and lab workers were analysed for microorganism contamination. A small number of studies verified that the same tourniquets were used continuously by professionals between 3 days to 104 weeks. Preliminary results evidenced contamination rates varying between 9% and 100%, composed by diverse microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus and Acinteobacter baumannii. Several of the included studies described conflicting practices during tourniquet manipulation by health professionals, especially when focused on domains such as hand hygiene before and after tourniquet use, glove usage during venipuncture, tourniquet cleaning and disinfecting, sharing tourniquets with other professionals and storage conditions. The most cited reason for tourniquet replacement in clinical settings was due to their loss by health professionals.",

        " Background ",
        "In Portugal, the number of centenarians almost tripled over the last decade from 589 centenarians in 2001 to 1526 in 2011 [1], and recent projections point to the existence of 3,393 centenarians in 2013 [2]. Reaching the age of 100, though an important landmark, does not necessarily indicates successful aging as it is often accompanied by severe health and functional constraints. Understanding health trajectories of these long-lived individuals and studying the prevalence of diseases that are the most common causes of death is important for conveniently addressing their current caregiving needs.",
        " Objective ",
        "The aim of this study is to present an overview of the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of two distinct samples of Portuguese centenarians (predominantly rural vs. predominantly urban) and acknowledge potential dissimilarities.",
        " Methods ",
        "A sample of 241 centenarians was considered (140 from the PT100 Oporto Centenarian Study and 101 from the PT100 Beira Interior Centenarian Study). Sociodemographic information, nature and number of diseases, functionality and physical health variables were collected.",
        " Results ",
        "In both samples, most centenarians were female (89.3% in Oporto, and 86.1% in Beira Interior), and widowed (76.4% in Oporto, 91.1% in Beira Interior), and lived in the community (57.9% in Oporto, 49.0% in Beira Interior). Higher levels of basic activities of daily living (BADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) dependency were found in the Oporto sample, as well as a higher percentage of bedridden centenarians (61.0% in Oporto vs. 38.1% in Beira Interior). Sensorial impairments and incontinence were the most frequent conditions reported in both samples; however, lower percentages of age-related illnesses were found in the Beira Interior sample. Considering the three most lethal diseases among the elderly population (heart disease, non-skin cancer and stroke), 60.0% of centenarians in Oporto escaped these conditions, whereas in Beira Interior this percentage increases to 85.4%.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This study provides a general overview about the health profile of Portuguese centenarians in two types of communities: one rural and with low population density, and another in an urban context. Our findings raise important differences between centenarians from the two samples, which reinforce the heterogeneity of this population, and the importance of environmental factors in how such an advanced age was achieved. Findings highlight the need for potentially distinctive health promotion initiatives in these two settings.",

        " Background ",
        "Functional decline, diminished performance in at least one activity of daily living, is often of 30 to 60% among hospitalized older adults (OA) [1]. Quality nursing care is essential to prevent functional decline. A \u201cnew\u201d theoretically based philosophy of care has been proposed: the Function Focused Care (FFC), which is geared toward optimization of function and physical activity during all personal/care related activities that occur throughout the hospital stay [2]. The FFC has demonstrated better outcomes at discharge and post-acute periods.",
        " Objective ",
        "To evaluate the effect of an educational program for nurses in promoting the FFC among hospitalized OA.",
        " Methods ",
        "This is a prospective quasi-experimental study developed in four internal medical units. These units were randomly selected in two units for case (intervention) and two for control. Participants were 117 OA and 94 registered nurses (RN). Intervention consisted in the development and implementation of an educational program about FFC to RN, lasting 10 hours, and a maintenance program, during 5 months. Further details about the program can be found in Tavares et al [3]. Implementation of FFC activities by RN was assessed through the FFC Behaviour Checklist, which was completed by the researchers through non-participant observation [4]. The measures for patients were the functional decline (DF) assessed by the Katz Index: difference between baseline and discharge (t0), discharge and follow-up of 3 months (t1) and baseline and follow-up (t2). For comparison of the case and control groups, an independent t-test was calculated.",
        " Results ",
        "The patient\u2019s sociodemographic and clinical characteristics showed no statistical differences between groups. The provision of FFC mean was 0.46 \u00b1 0.22, indicating that RN promoted only 46% of total possible FFC activities. Significant statistical differences were found between case and control group (t(91)= -2.85; p= 0.01), with means of 0.52 \u00b1 0.24 and 0.39 \u00b1 0.19, respectively. No statistical difference was found between the promotion of FFC and the functional decline at t0 (U = 30.5, p = 0.15), t1 (t(38.82) = 6.293; p< 0.15) or t2 (t(83) = 2.49, p = 0.44).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Promotion of functionality is very low, which could be explained by the lack of impact in FD prevention. However, in the case group, more FFC activities were developed. These results suggest a positive impact of the educational program in OA care. The FFC can be seen as a challenge and opportunity for change, innovation, and creativity, in order to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of care of hospitalized OA.",

        " Background ",
        "According to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence quality standards, the assessment of fall risk and preventing falls should be multifactorial and include self-reported questions like fall history, fear of falling (FoF), self-perception of functional ability, environment hazards, gait pattern, balance, mobility and muscle strength [1]. Concerning the self-reported data, some studies described subjectivity and difficulty in extracting reliable information when using such methods. History and number of previous falls are often used as golden standard in fall risk assessment studies [2]; however, these questions are source of misjudgement, in part, due to difficulty for an older person remember exactly how many times he/she had fallen in a past period of time.",
        " Objective ",
        "The study aimed to compare self-reported questions and standard and validated measures for screening risk of fall to verify the confidence of the self-reported data.",
        " Methods ",
        "506 community-dwelling adults aged 50+ years old (mean age 69.56 \u00b1\u200910.29 years old; 71.7% female) were surveyed regarding demographics, history of fall, FoF, sedentary lifestyle, use of upper-extremities to stand up from a chair, by self-reported questionnaire; analysis of gait, balance and muscle strength, by standard and validated measures for screening risk of fall - 10 meters walking speed test [3], Timed Up & Go test [4] and 30 second sit to stand test [4], respectively. Independent samples t tests were performed to compare groups.",
        " Results ",
        "33.2% of the sample reported at least one fall in the last year (fallers), 50% reported FoF, 46.4% sedentary lifestyle, 31.8% needed their upper extremities assistance to stand from a chair. Fallers demonstrated lower scores of gait velocity (p < 0.001), lower extremities strength (p < 0.001) and balance (p = 0.034) compared with non-fallers; who reported sedentary lifestyle also showed lower scores of gait velocity (p < 0.001), lower extremities strength (p = 0.001) and balance (p < 0.001) compared with non-sedentary. Simultaneously, who assumed FoF showed lower scores of gait velocity (p < 0.001), lower extremities strength (p < 0.001) and balance (p < 0.001) compared with who had no FoF. Finally, those who use the upper-extremities to stand up from a chair showed lower scores of gait velocity (p < 0.001), lower extremities strength (p < 0.001) and balance (p < 0.001) compared with those who do not.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The findings suggest that self-reported data like history of falls, sedentary lifestyle, FoF and use of upper extremities to stand up from a chair, obtained by simple questions, have emerged as reliable information on risk factors for falling and can be used to complete the fall risk screening.",

Previous studies have showed comparable findings [4,5,6], however, admitting the strong association between participation and 10 meters Walking Speed and TUG, it is essential to include these instruments in a comprehensive evaluation of the individuals who have suffered a fall in the past year to predict participation restrictions. The performance assessed, in few minutes, by these tests, will gather information about balance and mobility impairments, that associated with a quick assess of Self-efficacy for exercise [7] will outline the quality of life of persons with history of falls.",

        "Ageing population is a worldwide phenomenon. The number of older frail people increases rapidly, which leads to a substantial impact on the economic, social and health systems. Cardiovascular Health Study data [1] estimated that, in a population with 65 years or more, 6.3% of aged adults have the frailty phenotype. According to Fried et al., frailty is a vulnerable condition characterized by the decline of biological reserves [2,3]. This happens due to deregulation of multiple physiological systems, which puts the individuals at risk by reducing the organism resistance to stressful factors, with a subsequent loss of functional homeostasis. One of the most significant aspects described in the literature is the fact that frailty is an important risk factor for falls. It is estimated that one in every three adults over 65 years fall each year. The frailty syndrome also compromises the social participation of aged adults.",

Data were collected by a demographic, clinical and history of falls questionnaire, functional tests and the Activities and Participation Profile related to Mobility (PAPM).",
        " Results ",
        "We verified that there are statistically significant differences in the history of falls between no-frailty (n = 24; mean number of falls = 1.92) and frailty/pre-frailty (n = 31; mean number of falls = 3.06) individuals (p = 0.036), as well as in the social participation score of both groups, with worse profile among the frailty/pre-frailty (0.821), when compared to no-frailty (0.276) (p = 0.000).",

        "Historically, people with disabilities have been seen as asexual and their sexual rights were often neglected. Nowadays, some progresses have been made but they still face multiple stereotypes and barriers that limit their social and sexual lives. Sexual assistance is a way of sexual expression in which trained individuals provide sexual services to clients with disabilities, improving their well-being in relation to sexuality. However, in Portugal the only way to access commercial sex is through sex workers who have no training to attend disabled clients.",

Finally, the attendance theme explains the dynamics of the relationship established and the many obstacles they overcome in order to express their sexuality through commercial sex.",

Certain relationship specificities tend to be experienced with feelings of embarrassment on the part of professionals. Based on the experiences and obstacles sex workers observed when working with people with disabilities, measures were pointed out to improve the psychological and sexual health of those involved in the situation, which highlights the need for training to serve this group of clients, as well as the need for legalization of sex work.",

        " Background ",
        "In intimate partner violence, man is the main perpetrator of violence, and it is essential to include him in interventions to decrease violence, because he can take responsibility for violence, seeking new forms of expression. However, intervention with men is criticized, such as: using resources that could be targeted to victims; the imposition of re-education measures rather than punitive measures; consider that men do not change their behaviour [1]. Nevertheless, it is within the framework of evaluation that we find one of the major shortcomings of batterer intervention programs, since the effects of participation of men in that, have been receiving little analysis [2].",

        " Results ",
        "When asked about changes occurred after 3 months of follow-up in the program some men reported having not noticed any changes, which indicates that the program is not effective to all participants and the importance of longer follow-ups. However, most men cited changes in the way they act and perceive the division of tasks between men and women, thus participation in the program can be the starting point for rethinking and building new ways of expressing masculinity. And the changes cited go beyond the scope of the marital relationship, encompassing the relationship with the children, the abandonment of addictions and the desire to seek school education.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "According to the data, attention to perpetrators of violence has a positive influence not only in the behaviour towards the partner, but also on the relationship with children and the abandonment of addictions. Although longer follow-ups - including the couple - are needed, the batterer intervention program may be a tool to decrease violence against women.",

However, according to the professionals\u2019 opinion, there is a need for ampler capacitation of the teams implementing RBP, better articulation with the institutions regarding the used space and activities schedule, and better articulation with the elderly to guarantee their commitment to the program.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Reminiscence was shown to be effective in improving cognition and quality of life, as well as potentially effective in decreasing depressive symptomatology. Therefore, it presents a therapeutic potential, contributing to the improvement of the care provided. It is also worth mentioning the good acceptance of the program which, however, implies the qualification of the professional teams for its implementation.",

        " Background ",
        "Research has evidenced the positive impact of non-pharmacological therapies aimed at elderly people with cognitive decline in the institutional setting. Reminiscence Therapy (RT) emerges in this category as an enabling strategy, which favours moments of happiness, dignity and life purpose [1]. Nonetheless, studies centred in RT are limited in Portugal, with a clear absence of structured interventional programs, emerging the need to develop and validate well-defined and replicable RT programs [2].",
        " Objective ",
        "We intend to construct and validate a RT program directed to elderly people with cognitive decline, to be implemented in institutional settings by healthcare professionals.",
        " Methods ",
        "Guidelines for complex interventions development from the Medical Research Council were followed [3]. The program was conceptualized in four distinct phases: Phase I (Preliminary), the initial conceptualization of the program design and supportive materials; Phase II (Modelling), consisting in the conduction of interviews and focus groups with healthcare specialists; Phase III (Field Test), aiming at the evaluation of each program session; and Phase IV (Consensus Conference), to synthesize the contributions and analyse challenges that emerged in preceding phases.",
        " Results ",
        "Based on the contributions of experts, healthcare professionals and the institutionalized elderly, a RT program divided into two strands was formed. The main strand includes 14 sessions, performed twice a week. The maintenance strand included seven weekly sessions. Each thematic session is related to the participants' life course, with a maximum duration of 60 minutes. The 4-phase conceptualization process resulted in the creation of a digital platform with audio-visual contents to aid professionals during each session; inclusion of an introductory section that contextualizes the therapeutic potential of RT; introduction of complementary activities that can be developed additionally in the institutional settings; reinforcement of multisensory stimulation throughout the program; introduction of a final moment of relaxation through abdominal breathing. The terminology used and visual presentation of the program were reformulated in order to improve user experience. The created program was considered by the elderly and healthcare professionals involved during the course of this process as pleasant and interesting, praising its structure, thematic contents and proposed activities.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The involvement of experts and potential users enabled the program to mirror the needs of the elderly with cognitive decline in an institutional setting. The RT program, structured and validated in the course of this study, demonstrated characteristics adjusted to the target population and setting. However, the effectiveness of the program should be tested in a future pilot study.",

        " Methods ",
        "A single-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted at a Psychiatry Ward Outpatient Service of a Hospital in the north of Portugal. Participants were psychiatric outpatients, aged 18-64, with nursing diagnosis \u201canxiety\u201d, who were randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 29) or a treatment-as-usual control group (n = 31). The interventions consisted in psychotherapeutic interventions for the nursing diagnosis \u201canxiety\u201d, integrated in the Nursing Interventions Classification. One mental health nurse provided the individual-based intervention over a 5-week period (one 45-60 minutes weekly session). A treatment-as-usual control group received only pharmacotherapy (if applicable). The primary outcomes, anxiety level and anxiety self-control, were assessed with the outcomes \u201cAnxiety level\u201d and \u201cAnxiety self-control\u201d, integrated in the Nursing Outcomes Classification (Portuguese version) [5] respectively. Time frames for assessment were at baseline and post-test (6 weeks after).",

        "Patients from both groups presented improvements in anxiety levels, between the pre-test and the post-test assessment; however, analysis of means showed that patients of the intervention group presented significantly better results than those of the control group. Furthermore, only patients in the intervention group presented significant improvements in anxiety self- control. The psychotherapeutic intervention presented a very large effect size on the anxiety level and a huge effect size on the anxiety self-control. 22.8% and 40% of the outcomes related to the anxiety level and anxiety self-control, respectively, are predicted in the event of integrating the intervention group.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This study demonstrated the psychotherapeutic intervention model in nursing was efficacious in the decrease of anxiety level and improvement of anxiety self-control in a group of Portuguese adult psychiatric outpatients with pathological anxiety, immediately after the intervention. The results of the multiple linear regression and the very large effect size identified suggest that a significant part of the improvements could be directly attributed to the intervention.",

The approach in the home nursing visit was directed to the well-being of the new born and its mother, appearing to the family as a resource, not having the concern to explore the interaction and the reciprocity within the family. We highlight three dimensions: Postpartum home visit, that describes the experiences of the participants about the care operationalized in this visit; Family Nursing, which traces the way they understand the work of the family nurse in this transition and, lastly, the Postpartum parenting, which reports the mother perception about this stage of the life cycle.",

        "Among the 453 gym/fitness users (61.3% female; 38.7% male) who participated in the survey, 50 (11.1%) reported PES use (5.4% female; 19.5% male). The mean age of PES users was 34.96 years (Std. Dev. = 10.00). They were married, unemployed and with a low level of education (until 9 years = 41.7%). PES users showed more years of training (4 years) than no PES users. The main sports modalities of the respondents were cardio fitness (57.0%), bodybuilding (56.5%), stretching (27.8%) and localized (27.2%). PES use was suggested mostly by friends (51.9%), peers (30.8%) and by internet (30.8%). The most commonly consumed PES were diuretics (46.0%) and anabolic steroids (44.0%). Thirty percent of PES users reported side effects and the most commonly reported was acne (53.3%), agitation and tremors (40.0%). The main reason for using PES is the improvement of the physical condition (54.0%). Five-point three percent of non-PES users expressed an interest in using PES in the future.",

        "This study was conducted in one PC unit in the north region of Portugal with a convenience sample of 136 OA (\u2265 65 years). The questionnaire included: 1) sociodemographic, family and health variables; and 2) the frailty instruments P7, FF and IFG. OA were considered frail: \u2265 3 positive questions out of 7 for P7; \u22653 factors out of 5 for FF; and \u2265 4 dimensions out of 8 for IFG. Further details about these scales can be found in Machado. For the concurrent validity, methods based on correlation (Spearman Rank test) and agreement (Cohen's Kappa, sensitivity and specificity values) were used. For comparison of the two groups (frailty or non-frailty), an independent t-test was calculated. Finally, binary logistic regression model was considered to identify predictors of frailty.",

        "According to the characterization of P7, IFG and FF, the prevalence of frail OA was 7.4%, 19.9% and 26.5%, respectively. The agreement percentage between the instruments was moderate ranging from 68% to 77%, observing that the P7 is partially concordant with the other instruments. The P7 showed high specificity values, but low sensitivity values. Frail OA were characterized (p < 0.05) as being older, having worse health perception, lower physical capacity, slower walking velocity, higher IFG scores, and decreased hand grip strength. As predictors of frailty, in the multivariate model, older age (OR = 1.111) and better physical capacity (OR = 0.675) were significant (p < 0.01).",

Ideally, the identification of children at risk of failure to learn reading and writing should occur in the last year of pre-school or early in the first year, so that intentional programs can be implemented to promote basic reading skills [2,3,4]. The most promising reading learning support programs combine explicit phonological awareness training with highly structured reading instruction [5,6].",
        " Objective ",
        "This study evaluated the impact of two early intervention programs on reading learning difficulties. A program exclusively in virtual environment and a hybrid program, comprising sessions in virtual environment and in real environment.",
        " Methods ",
        "Participants were 57 children, attending the first year of schooling, native speakers of European Portuguese, identified as at risk of having learning reading difficulties. The children were divided into three groups: (a) virtual environment intervention - training with Graphogame software, (b) hybrid intervention - training using Graphogame software and real-time sessions of pre-reading and reading skills oriented by a technician from the CiiL team (Center for Research and Intervention in Reading) and (c) absence of intervention beyond that provided for in the regular system of education. The intervention programs were developed in a school context, with the virtual component (Graphogame) developed with daily periodicity, with duration between 10 to 15 minutes. The intervention in real environment was carried out once a week, with activities of 30 to 40 minutes, using materials of a playful character, created specifically for the present study.

        "The early intervention in reading difficulties should promote the explicit training of phonemic awareness and letter-sound relations in order for the decoding process to be developed. Although the virtual environment \u2013 in this case the software Portuguese Basis Graphogame \u2013 is a highly effective tool, ideally, it should be combined with a real-environment intervention to ensure that the child effectively dominates letter-sound relationships and that trains intensively the decoding process.",

        " Background ",
        "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a hypersensitivity reaction caused when inhaled particles contact the nasal mucosa and induce an immunoglobulin E -mediated inflammatory response resulting in sneezing, nasal itching, rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, or a combination of those symptoms [1]. The prevalence of AR is sometimes cited as 10% to 30% in adults [1]. It is increasingly recognized that the symptoms of AR often adversely impact the quality of life of the affected individuals and impose a significant health and socio-economic burden on the individual and society [2].",
        " Objective ",
        "The aims of the present research were to estimate the prevalence of AR, determine the predominance of the symptoms, determine the impact on quality of life (QoL), as well as characterize the control strategies and treatment of AR in pharmacy customers of Guarda city.",
        " Methods ",
        "An observational, cross-sectional and analytical study was conducted, and a questionnaire survey was developed and used as the data collection instrument. This included the Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma (CARAT) test and the scale Quality of Life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-Bref). Data collection took place in community pharmacies in the city of Guarda between May and December of 2014.",
        " Results ",
        "In the sample of 804 respondents, there was a predominance of females (66.3%) and the average age was 48.3 \u00b1 16.5 years. The prevalence rate of AR was 13.1% (95 % CI 10.8\u201315.4). About 40% of the respondents with AR had no medical diagnosis. It was verified that there weren\u2019t differences by gender in terms of quality of life (p = 0.929) or in the control of the AR symptoms (p = 0.168). On another hand, a high level of education (higher education) seemed to be a factor that contributed to a better quality of life (p = 0.001) and to a better control of symptoms (p = 0.019). It was also observed that a better control of the symptoms of AR was associated with a better quality of life (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.292, p = 0.003).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The prevalence rate was estimated between 10.8% and 15.4%, which resulted from the medical diagnosis and the symptomatic diagnosis made through the data collection instrument. The results indicated that although the respondents do not have properly controlled the AR and suffer from associated comorbidities, they have a reasonable quality of life indexes.",

        "The aging process, understood as dynamic and progressive, contributes to the reduction of physical reserves and a higher prevalence of pathological processes, predisposing the elderly to frailty [1]. Canadian researchers define frailty as a multifactor syndrome involving biological, physical, cognitive, and social factors [2], which contribute significantly to disability and hospitalization [3]. Considered a modern geriatric syndrome, it is related to physiological changes, diseases, polypharmacy, malnutrition, social isolation and unfavourable economic situation [4, 5].",

A cross-sectional study was carried out with 374 elderly individuals in outpatient care between October 2015 and March 2016. Data collection was applied to the Edmonton Fragility Scale [2]. Data were analysed by Stata software version 12 and described by measures of frequency, mean and standard deviation (SD). Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to investigate associations between independent variables and frailty. The adjusted prevalence ratios were obtained by multiple Poisson regression analysis. It was started with a saturated model and the variables that were not statistically relevant were removed, since their exclusion did not modify the results of the independent variables that remained in the model.

        "Portugal has a story of almost two decades of computerized information systems use on health area, particularly in the nursing area, with the large-scale implementation of Computerized Information Systems to support nursing practice. We know that the use of electronic health information to support patient care will undoubtedly be responsible for a substantial time-spent on the overall workload of nurses. Too often, we are confronted with nurses\u2019 opinions that the use of computerized information systems (CIS) has a great impact on the overall nurses\u2019 workload (35 to 50% of the global nurses\u2019 workload).",
        " Objective ",
        "To identify the perception of nurses on the time spent on CIS in use in a hospital and his impact on the global nurses\u2019 workload.",
        " Methods ",
        "A cross-sectional survey was applied to collect data from 148 nurses that use CIS in a hospital (medical and surgical services). This allowed knowing the average percentage of nurses\u2019 perception time spent on the use of SClinico\u00ae and other information supports, as well as their distribution by a set of nursing activities in use of the system.",
        " Results ",
        "The results showed that nurses consider that time spent on information supports has an average of 42.4% on their total working time: 33.5% on the use of SCl\u00ednico\u00ae (mode and median of 30%; SD \u00b116.25) and 8.9 % (mode and median of 5 %; SD \u00b16.67) on nursing records in other non-computerized structures (particularly on paper). These values are overlapping to those presented in some national and international studies. However, results are higher than the real-time shown in studies of Silva (2001) and Sousa and colleagues (2015). Nurses who underwent training processes on Nursing Information System in use (SCl\u00ednico\u00ae) and on ICNP\u00ae have differences in time-spent perception on the use of CIS.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "A permanent issue in the debate on the use of CIS is the time spent in its use, in particular in the processes of data access, care planning, and record keeping. Nurses have the perception that the time spent on CIS has, in fact, an essential part of nursing practice, but with a high impact on the workload of nurses. However, there are several national and international studies that point out in certain contexts for a lower \u201creal-time\u201d in the global nurses\u2019 workload on the use of computerized information systems.",

Eighty three percent (n = 54) reported experiencing pain, and from these, 45 (83.3%) had pain for more than one year. Pain was mainly localized in the knees (n = 30) and in the lower back (n = 27). Our sample spent an average of 5h46min per day in sedentary behaviour (< 1.5 METs) and 4h47min in physical activity of light intensity (> 1.5 and < 3 METs, Metabolic Equivalents). Physical activity of low intensity showed a non-significant association with the presence of pain (p = 0.622) nor with the duration of pain (p = 0.525).",

The education level of support staff and the health status of the person with the ID had largely explained the discrepancies between people with ID and key workers. Furthermore, the results revealed that four characteristics were major predictors of disagreement between people with ID and family members: the age of the person with ID, the type of transportation, the self-reported health status of the person with ID, and the health status of the person with the ID, as assessed by the family members. Finally, robust factors seemed to explain the discrepancies between practitioners and family members: living circumstances, self-reported health status of the person with the ID, education level of the key worker and education level of family members.",

        "Pressure ulcers management is a challenge [1-6]. Portuguese guidelines [7] encourage the implementation of regular pressure ulcer risk assessments through the application of the Braden Scale and the patients\u2019 categorisation into two levels of risk (defined by cut-off point of 16). However, the development of pressure ulcer(s) is complex and multifactorial [8] and whenever the Braden Scale score falls below 18, each patient functional deficit and/or risk factor should be individually addressed [9].",
        " Objective ",
        "To analyse the Braden Scale accuracy tests in adult patients admitted to general wards in a Portuguese hospital during one year, using different cut-off points.",
        " Methods ",
        "The study was designed as a retrospective cohort analysis of electronic health record database from 6,552 adult patients admitted without any pressure ulcer in medical and surgical wards in a Portuguese hospital during 2012. All data were extracted after Hospital Council Board and Ethics Committee approval (Reference Number 049688). Braden Scale Accuracy Tests (BSAT) such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and the area under the curve (AUC) were assessed [10].",
        " Results ",
        "The study included 6,552 participants with a mean age of 64 years and 6 months. The majority of participants was male (52.6%); admitted trough emergency service (69.1%); in surgical (64.5%) units. During the length of stay 153 (2.3%) participants developed (at least) one pressure ulcer. Considering the cut-off point of 15, the BSAT showed: sensitivity of 50%(95%CI:42%-58%); specificity of 82%(95%CI:81%-83%); PPV of 6%(95%CI:5%-8%); NPV 99%(95%CI:98%-99%); and AUC of 66%(95%CI:61%-71%). Considering the cut-off point of 16, the BSAT showed: sensitivity of 63%(95%CI:55%-71%); specificity of 74%(95%CI:73%-75%); PPV of 5%(95%CI:4%-7%); NPV 99%(95%CI:98%-99%); and AUC of 69%(95%CI:64%-73%). Considering the cut-off point of 17 the BSAT showed: sensitivity of 78%(95%CI:71%-84%); specificity of 63%(95%CI:61%-64%); PPV of 5%(95%CI:4%-6%); NPV 99%(95%CI:99%-99%); and AUC of 71%(95%CI:67%-74%).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Although our BSATs follow the trend of the results found in a recent systematic review [11], they showed some of the limitations of the patients\u2019 categorisation into two levels of risk according to a specific cut-off value. Like Braden [9], we believe that this assessment tool should be supplied with clinical judgment in order to identify patients\u2019 specific risk factors that should be individually addressed with accurate preventive interventions. Furthermore, in order to develop evidence-based practice, we should create a minimum data set for pressure ulcer prevention, assessment and documentation [12-14] based on patients\u2019 characteristics, international guidelines [15] and conceptual frameworks [12-14].",

        "Primary school students usually have very little previous knowledge about a number of educational issues. So, it is important to create moments where the students can tell whatever they know about a subject, in order to make an additional scientific explanation. The program of the 1st cycle of basic education aims to develop an attitude of permanent research and experimentation, and the part \u201cThe health of your body\u201d, to produce knowledge and the application of norms of body hygiene [1]. However, the contents expressed in the textbooks for these levels of education do not justify the need for children to adopt these hygiene habits, which must be acquired as early as possible, to be a systematic routine throughout life. On the other hand, it allows to eradicate some of the alternative conceptions that some 1st cycle students present on some issues [2], as the notion about the morphological view of microorganisms away from reality, idealizing them similar to animals [3,4,5]. There is evidence that children are able to learn about microorganisms at this age [3,4,5] and it is desirable that it occurs as early as possible, avoiding late conceptual changes that are difficult to reconstruct in their entirety [4]. For some authors [6,7], children should realize that the knowledge learned in the classroom can be applied in their daily lives.",
        " Objective ",

It started with the question \u201cHandwashing: Why, When, How?\u201d. According to the conceptions expressed by the students the appropriate theoretical contents were presented in a gradual and interactive way. This was followed by the experimental procedure with permanent monitoring and support based on the succeeding steps: role-playing stages for proper handwashing; applied activity; listing expected results; observation of cultures and microscopic observation of microorganisms, recording and reflection about the results achieved.",

        "About a third of community-dwelling adults age 65 and older fall each year. Accidental falls are a cause of fractures, traumatic brain injury, and even death. They can also lead to restrictions in participation, eventually resulting in loss of independence in normal activities of self-care. Falls in older adults are multifactorial and can be caused by medical conditions, cognitive impairment, medications, and home hazards. Therefore, a single identifiable factor may account for only a small portion of the fall risk in the community-dwelling elderly population, stressing the need for a multifactorial evaluation in this population.",
        " Objective ",
        "Identify the risk of accidental falls in an independent elderly population by using functional tests that can be routinely applied in clinical practice and evaluate the influence of medication in the risk of falling.",
        " Methods ",
        "The sample consisted of 108 individuals who attended a health care facility between October 2016-January 2017. Inclusion criteria: age 65-85, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) \u2265 120 and Timed Up and Go (TUG) \u2264 12s. Individuals with serious cognitive or motor impairment were excluded. A form was filled with sociodemographic data, daily medication and history of falls. Handgrip strength was measured. Fear of falling was assessed using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. Participation was evaluated using the Activities and Participation Profile related to Mobility (APPM). Informed written consent was obtained for all participants.",
        " Results ",
        "The average age was 72.28\u00b16.02. The majority of subjects were female (54.6%). Fallers were older, had lower ABC and handgrip strength. ABC showed strong negative associations with APPM. All of the functional parameters were affected by age, with older individuals performing worse than younger participants. Polypharmacy was identified in 41.7% and increased the risk of falls (OR = 3.597; CI 95% 1.174-11.024; p = 0.025). Individuals taking antidepressants showed an increased risk of falls (OR = 9.467; CI 95% 2.337-38.495; p = 0.002). Anti-arrhythmic drugs (p = 0.002), benzodiazepines (p = 0.015) and other CNS-acting medication (p = 0.039) negatively influenced ABC scores. APPM scores were higher in subjects who reported taking CNS-acting medication (p = 0.012) and anti-arrhythmic medication (p = 0.035).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Individuals with low balance confidence showed higher restrictions in participation related to mobility. All of the functional parameters evaluated in this study were affected by age. These results stress that a comprehensive and multifactorial evaluation of risk factors for falls in older people and the adoption of interventions tailored to this age group, which could include a reassessment of their usual medication, are necessary in order to reduce fall risk and fall-related injury.",

        "For the last 10 years, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions have been conquering an important place in policies addressing economic and social challenges resulting from population ageing [1]. The AAL concept corresponds to a new paradigm building on ubiquitous computing devices and new interaction forms to improve older adults\u2019 health, autonomy and security [2]. In spite of promising contributions of AAL solutions for ageing in place, low adoption by end users was reported [3-5]. This is thought to result from the intersection of technology features, user characteristics and attitudes [6]. Research has suggested that among attitudinal factors preventing adoption of these solutions there is a lack of trust, substantiated, among other factors, by user\u2019s concerns about data security and privacy [5,7-10]. Digital advisory services for AAL solutions have to foster not only user\u2019s trust on the advisory service per se, but also on AAL products and services and the web communication within a community.",

        "A qualitative approach was used. Thirty-eight semi-structured interviews with AAL stakeholders\u2013 older adults and informal caregivers, businesses and government representatives\u2013 were conducted in six European countries (Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal and UK). The data was analysed using the matrix method [11].",
        " Results ",
        "For the uptake of AAL digital advisory services, the level of user\u2019s trust in the system seems to be critical. Features emerging as crucial to foment trust in digital advisory services were threefold: presence of security and privacy cues; personalization-related cues; and community features, including availability of client-to-client interactions and feedback given by reliable peers or experts. Older adults expressed their interest in becoming active in a digital community if provided an environment perceived as secure and, simultaneously, easy to use.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Building trust in AAL digital advisory services depends on multiple and complex user requirements. Security issues have shown to be of utmost relevance due to the nature of information exchanged, i.e. personal, health-related and sensitive data, and generational preferences, with privacy and security cues having primacy for \u2018Baby Boomers\u2019, as supported by previous research [12]. These findings stress the need for a paradigm shift towards user-centred and user empowering models and mechanisms for securing the interaction with systems (e.g. authentication mechanisms, access control models and visualization techniques; e.g. SoTRAACE model) [13].",

Approximately 10% of the results computed were in areas that focused on Gains in FC performance (11.20%), Gains in performance of dependent persons (10.43%) and Gains in the prevention of Ulcers of Pressure (9.32%). With an order of magnitude in the order of 3.30% emerged the field of indicators related to Gains in the evolution of nursing diagnoses centred on the Role of Care Provider.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Reflecting on these results allows a more effective approach to the representation of nursing care in the evaluation of quality and, certainly, a better redefinition of the panel of indicators at the national level, with \u201csensitivity\u201d to the nursing work developed by ICCT.",

        "There is a growing prevalence of disability worldwide, which indicates an increasing number of persons who might benefit from assistive technologies. Several studies showed positive effects of the use of assistive technologies on activity and participation of adults with mobility impairments [1, 2], as well as on psychosocial factors [3, 4].",
        " Objective ",
        "The purpose of this study is to assess the psychosocial impact of the powered wheelchair, evaluating its repercussions on the social participation of its users.",
        " Methods ",
        "Design - Observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study; Setting \u2013 All data was collected from May to October 2017; Participants - 30 powered wheelchair users with mean age of 40.63 years old (60% male) with diverse medical conditions (SCI, TBI, CP, among others); Main outcome measures - Interviews were conducted by an independent researcher using the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST), the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS) and the Activities and Participation Profile Related to Mobility (PAPM), in addition to demographic, clinical and wheelchair-related questions.",
        " Results ",
        "Participants were quite satisfied with both the assistive technologies and the related services, with the lowest QUEST scores belonging to those who had been using their wheelchairs for a longer period of time. PAPM scores revealed significant restrictions in participation (6.7% of participants with mild restrictions, 56.7% with moderate restrictions and 36.7% with severe restrictions), with a worst participation profile also among the users who had the wheelchairs for a longer period. The most satisfied users were the ones with better performance in terms of social participation. PIADS scores showed a positive impact of the powered wheelchairs in all subscales, with the following average scores: total 1.37, competence 1.39, adaptability 1.32 and self-esteem 1.38. The psychosocial impact, in terms of adaptability, was higher among users who transitioned from a manual wheelchair to a powered wheelchair compared to those who already had a powered wheelchair previously (1.85 vs 1.10; p = 0.02).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "There was an overall positive psychosocial impact of powered wheelchairs, and, therefore, an increase in the quality of life of the users. Adaptability to the device seems to be the most contributing factor to social participation.",

Job status (employed versus unemployed) did not present a statistically significant relationship with BF duration. As to the age of the child when the mother returned to work, we verified a statistically significant relationship (p = 0.001) with BF duration. The level of difficulty the mother experienced in reconciling her job with BF also presented a statistically significant relationship (p = 0.002) with BF duration.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The majority of mothers reported difficulties in reconciling work with BF. Women who returned to work before their child was 6 months old had shorter BF duration. This reinforces the need to explore family\u2019s timely expectations, and plan strategies to promote an effective management of work and BF. In this context, we believe there is a need to establish in our culture jurisdiction policies that favour BF and work. Health professionals should act as mediators in the definition of family-oriented health policies. In this case, the extension of a parental leave for mothers up to 6 months postpartum, the existence of a place at work where breastfeeding mothers can extract and conserve their breastmilk or the existence of day-care centres in the workplace, in accordance to the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding [6,7], may prolong BF duration and ease mothers difficulty in managing BF when returning to work.",

One in each four patients of DM develop Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) in their lifetime, ending some in amputations and consequently in death [1]. Furthermore, the Directorate-General of Health estimated that in 2016, the prevalence of DFU was of 11.5% in the Portuguese population [2]. Throughout the years, DFU assessment tools have been created, such as: I) scales, which depend on visual examination being highly subjective; II) invasive methods that use manual procedures for depicting the shape, area, depth and volume of wounds, that are time consuming, susceptible to human errors and can lead to wound contamination [3]; or III) non-invasive methods such as optical based techniques which provide three-dimensional information about the lesion, which are expensive, time consuming and require user training [4].

        "Elders were most from female gender (60.1%), aged between 65 and 74 years (49.6%) and lived in rural areas (73.4%). Just 36.5% of the elderly practice physical exercise and an important amount of elderly drink coffee and tea (68.8% and 73.2%, respectively). Concerning sleep characteristics, the elders go to bed between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. and about half of participants (52.8%) go between 10 p.m. and 12 a.m. Approximately one third had difficulty in falling asleep (38.1%), especially the elderly from the region of Bragan\u00e7a. During sleep, a large proportion of the elderly reported having sleep stops (78.2%) usually for 15-30 minutes and 26.5% reported waking up twice during the night. Taking into account that the time of delay to sleep is an important factor, in the present study, this was statistically related with the gender (p = 0.003) and with taking medication to sleep (p < 0.001). The same two factors are statistically related with \u201cwake up during the night\u201d (p = 0.046, p = 0.003, respectively). 40.7% of the surveyed elderly have been diagnosed with sleep disorders, mainly insomnia (19.7%) following by restless legs syndrome (3.4%), excessive drowsiness (2.9%) and sleep apnoea, sleep-walking and narcolepsy (about 1%). It is important to refer that among the elderly, that assume to suffer from sleep disorders, just 40.7% have been consulted by a physician. Of those who consulted a doctor, 21.3% of the elderly were advised to change their lifestyle habits, such as, to avoid heavy meals before bedtime, to establish a sleep routine, to lie down only when he/she is sleepy and to practice physical activity. Concerning the pharmacological therapy, 41.7% take medication for sleep disorders, 9% take medication without consulting a doctor, while 32.5% elderly people take medication after consulting a doctor. From these, the most used are benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (12.5%), diazepam (8.6%), lorazepam (4.5%) and brotizolam (3.7%).",

        "Assessment of the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) on cell lines of EC (OE19) and of BC (HT1376), namely viability and cell proliferation, characterisation of cellular death type and cell cycle, as well to establish survival factor and determination of the aggression model, after different radiation dose exposure to calculate half lethal dose (DL50).",
        " Methods ",
        "Cell lines were cultured and exposed to single-shot doses of X-rays from 0.5 Gy to 12.0 Gy, except control cells (0.0 Gy). Cell viability and proliferation were assessed by trypan blue assay. The proliferation index determination was performed by immunocytochemistry trough Ki-67 expression. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell death type and cell cycle and the main morphological features of cell death were evaluated by May-Gr\u00fcnwald Giemsa stain. Clonogenic assays enabled assessment to differences in reproductive viability (capacity of cells to produce progeny) [5\u201311].",

Main types of cell death observed were apoptosis or necrosis. We also observed cell cycle arrest on G2/M phase and a decrease of the Ki-67 expression in both cell lines studied. The cell survival curves were established according to the quadratic linear model for both cell lines. For OE19 cell line the DL50 was 2.47 Gy and for HT1376 cell line was 3.10 Gy, accompanied by a decrease in the survival factor for both lines.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The direct effects of the DNA molecule that are unrepairable, activate multiple intracellular mechanisms on radio-sensitivity, such as cell death, namely by apoptosis and necrosis and cell cycle arresting G2/M phase. The increase radiation dose induces alterations in cell death, from apoptosis to necrosis. According to our results, OE19 is more radio-sensible than HT1376 cell line. This study demonstrates that molecular mechanisms underlying RT are important in oesophageal adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer therapeutic approaches.",

        " Conclusions ",
        "Our study did not establish a correlation between maternal age and BF duration which contradicts other findings [1\u20133] and can be explained by pregnancy and childbirth postponement nationwide [4]. In relation to mothers\u2019 educational level, we verified a statistically significant relationship with BF duration, being that the mothers who detained a higher level of education, breastfed longer [1,5\u20137]. As for marital status, we did not verify a statistically significant relationship with BF duration, which is in line with a recent Portuguese study [5] but differs from other international studies [2,3] that refer that married mothers breastfeed longer. This difference can be explained by cultural differences and by the paradigmatic change of the women\u2019s role, concept of marriage, and a diversity of forms of family life (great increase in unmarried couples). We also verified an increasing tendency in BF duration with the increase of the number of older children [6,7], but it was not lowest in primiparous women which contradicts other findings [6,7]. This may be clarified, once again, by the sociodemographic changes in the last decade in Portugal that include population ageing, an increasing tendency for families with an only child [4] and the great investment in parenthood and child well-being. Health care professionals should consider that sociodemographic characteristics are in constant change and so is its relation to health. These findings help health professionals to identify who may be most vulnerable to early weaning and allows them to explore expectations and develop a care plan accordingly.",

        "Direct Digital Manufacturing is an emerging set of technologies, which are able to produce complex objects without the need for molds or specific tooling. The preparation of food for human consumption is a centuries old craft, which results in food with high sugar and salt levels leading to a poor health for many people and not contributing to the recovery of seriously ill-hospitalized patients. One of the key challenges is to tailor food to the individual to match their dietary requirement and metabolic characteristics. We believe that direct digital manufacturing is able to address these issues. To date the use of 3D printing for food has been restricted to the production of aesthetic shapes for chocolate and pasta products. We see the potential in a different way in which we can tailor the food to the individual incorporating where required drug-based therapies whilst retaining the requirements to be visually pleasing. In addition, it will be possible to guarantee all the organoleptic characteristics to which the consumer in general is familiar (such as smell, sound and texture). The mouth is the gateway for food and its acceptance requires specific taste triggers. We consider that by exploiting Direct Digital Manufacturing it will possible to optimize such taste triggers whilst retaining the nutritional balance and potential. Every consumer (in general) has challenges in chewing and swallowing and engineered food has the capability to achieve this, especially when coupled with a model of the processes of the mouth and the oesophagus, parameterized to the individual. Once the food reaches the digestive system, all of the foregoing topics are largely irrelevant, other than to consider where the nutritional or therapeutic agents are extracted. The challenge of the oral intake of insulin is the best-known situation, but the delivery of chemotherapeutics is another area of challenges. It is necessary to shield the toxic therapeutic from the taste sensors and the digestive system so that it reaches the critical area of the digestive system intact. We are developing a comprehensive food design and manufacturing system that will allow each of these challenges to be met. We expect the first use of such system will be to expedite the recovery of seriously ill patients in hospitals. As enhanced testing procedures become more widely available through technological developments a wider use in the home is expected.",

        "Forty-nine elderlies were recruited for this research with 64.39 (\u00b1 6.33) years old, 11 males with 67.45 (\u00b1 4.93) and 38 females with 63.50 (\u00b1 7.47) years old. The subjects were community living persons of Bragan\u00e7a. All procedures carried out in this research were in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki. The multicomponent training program followed the Carvalho et al. [1], recommendations. Each session time volume was between 50 to 60 minutes. The sessions were divided in five parts: 1) general warm-up; 2) walking with aerobic exercises; 3) 1 to 3 sets of exercises of muscular resistance with 12 to 15 repetitions; 4) Static and dynamic balance training; 5) An active recovery period with stretching and breading exercises. The elderlies gait was evaluated with Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and BMM with bioimpedance (Tanita, BC-545). The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test allowed to assess the differences between pre and post 8 months of the training program in BBS and BMM. The tests were performed with a significant level of 5%.",

        "The BBS values pre and post the multicomponent training program for BBS were 47.33 and 50.33 respectively. In BMM, the pre and post values were 2.36kg and 2.39 kg. Despite the differences in BMM means, they were not significant between the two moments (F = 1.253; p = 0.706). However, the same did not occur in terms of BMS values (F = 1.967; p< 0.001), where gait values increased significantly in the second moment.",

First, a quantitative study was carried out using the scales: EHA (eating habits scale), TAA-25 (eating attitudes test) and GSQ (general self-efficacy scale). In a second step, a qualitative study was carried out with subgroups that were selected from the results of the first phase of the study. These subgroups presented opposite patterns of habits (group A: better eating habits - EHA\u2265160 and group B: worst habits - EHA\u2264125) and we moved into a grounded theory approach with semi-structured individual interviews.",
        " Results ",
        "Gender emerges as a determinant of eating choices pattern, with girls assuming more adequate eating habits (t =3.84; p <. 0001; r2adjusted= .037, p< .0001). The perception of general self-efficacy assumes greater relevance for boys, functioning as a protective factor that reduces unhealthy options. Through multinomial regression models, we could see that gender and general self-efficacy have a big influence on eating habits. The ideals of beauty have influence on this effect. Resisting adversity has an important influence in the choices, being associated to self-regulation. The situations of risk to develop an eating behaviour disturbance appear mainly in the cases of adolescents presenting better habits (rSP= .203; p < .001) and are more frequent in girls (t = 3.54; p < .0001; OR = 4.04). Through content analysis it was possible to identify determinant factors that were perceived by adolescents in both groups. The ones that were more often mentioned (in a decreasing order) were family influence, taste preferences, knowledge of healthy eating rules and availability. This was followed by determinants such as self-control capacity, feeling well or bad, peer influence, feeling hungry or full, developing a task or not, impulsiveness, time available and humour/stress.",

        "After analysing the results, we became aware that students with extracurricular physical activities had better results in motor skills than students with curricular physical activities. This result is perhaps the less surprising in the set of all assessments due to the longer physical commitment of these students in relation to the students that only exercise in the context of curricular activities. Regarding physical fitness, students with extracurricular physical activity can have more students in HFZ (healthy fitness zone) than students with curricular physical activity. Regarding the arms extension and flexion, 26% of the students with curricular physical activity are above HFZ, achieving better performance than the students that have extracurricular physical activity. According to the skills measured, the students with extracurricular physical activities achieve a relatively higher average than students with curricular physical activities.

Only 14.5% of patients were given instructions about the treatment of side effects, and only 12.5% of them were given instructions about oral hygiene care. Only 2.7% of the patients had their oral cavity/mucous membranes examined, and all of them were diagnosed with OM.

        "Health is a demanding scenario of changes and successive adaptations that, very easily, allows the emergence of differences between the involved and conflicts between professionals. Ineffectively managed conflicts in health organizations reduce quality, compromise safety, and increase the costs of health care delivery, secondarily to the goals of being effective and efficient.",
        " Objective ",
        "Thus, the general objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between the conflict management styles used and the level of patient safety climate among the clinical services professionals at Hospital P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3 of CHCB.",
        " Methods ",
        "The research is of a quantitative nature, of a descriptive and correlational character and of a transverse nature. The sample is non-probabilistic, consisting of 137 health professionals who work at CHCB. The use of ROCI-II and SAQ allowed the evaluation of the styles of conflict management and the perceptions of attitudes of health professionals related to patient safety.",
        " Results ",
        "The results show that professionals, in all relations with the opponent, opt preferentially for collaboration, with competition being the least common style of conflict management. There were no differences in the styles of conflict management used in relation to the opponent. The participants presented positive attitudes towards the patient's safety, and it was verified that the professionals perceived a lower security relative to the dimension of management's perception and greater in relation to the dimensions of job satisfaction and recognition of stress, which show the highest values. The relationship between conflict management styles and the security climate level was verified. There is an association between literacy and conflict management styles, and years of service and conflict management styles. Regarding the ordinal independent variables, all are associated with the perceptions of the security climate.",

        "Participants (n = 11) submitted to CS, of both sexes, between 25 and 64 years of age (61.09 \u00b1 7.09 years), that according to the American Heart Association and the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, met the criteria for low or moderate risk, class B for participation and exercise supervision, absence of signs/symptoms after CS, with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40%. Supervised interventions were performed during hospitalization, pre- and post-cardiac surgery, and 1 month after hospital discharge. In phase II, a physical exercise program was fulfilled according to the norms of the American College of Sports Medicine, comprising 3 sessions of physical exercise per week lasting between 30 to 60 minutes, including heating, aerobic exercise and recovery/stretching. Hemodynamic data (blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, pain) and the Borg scale were recorded in the initial, intermediate and final periods of each session. The aerobic capacity was evaluated through the 6-minute Walk Test and the health-related quality of life using the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36V2) questionnaire.",
        " Results ",
        "Significant statistical improvements were observed in the time/walk relationship, such as the increase in the respective functional capacity (p = 0.05) and quality of life (in various domains). During the hospitalization, the subjective perception of the effort of session to session decreased in 81.82% of the participants. T-test for independent samples revealed that differences in resting heart rate (phase I) were not significant, however, the difference in distances was significant at a 95% confidence level.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Nursing rehabilitation care is essential to improve the quality of life of patients undergoing CS in a phase I and II rehabilitation program. The benefits of CR programs are evident when initiated early after CC, reinforcing the need to increase their implementation in the rehabilitation of cardiovascular disease.

The TAAQ-PT presented a Cronbach alpha of .91. Additionally, composite reliability (CR) was calculated, and a value of .95 was found. The TAAQ-PT presented significant negative correlations with mindfulness facets (r = -.60; p <.01), and work engagement (r = -62, p <.01), and positive correlations with negative emotional symptoms of depression (r = .69; p <.01), anxiety (r = .63; p <.01) and stress (r = .70; p <.01).",

Also in girls, upper limbs injuries were associated with higher scores in the moods and emotions dimension, and the spine and torso with lower scores (p = .037).

        "Surprisingly given the large number of injuries resulting from participation in sports and the associated high costs of health care, very few investigations have been conducted into biosocial variables and their relation to sports injuries. Injuries in the Portuguese youth were linked to three dimensions of KIDSCREEN-52 (moods and emotions, self-perception and school environment) and parents education level. Sports injuries usually result from the combination of several risk factors interacting at a given time [9]. Understanding the role of social and environmental factors related to sports injuries is needed, as they can be a part of this complex equation.",

        "As a result of the ageing process, there is evidence of a decline in physical aptitude (strength, endurance, agility and flexibility) associated with a lower performance in the activities of daily living [1]. Physical activity plays therefore a key role in maintaining the health and physical fitness of the elderly [2]. The recommendations on physical activity for health suggest that the elderly should perform at least 30 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity per day [3, 4].",
        " Objective ",
        "The aim of this paper is to accurately quantify physical activity time in the elderly and to verify the existence of differences regarding physical fitness levels between two groups of people: those who complied and those who did not comply with the Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health [4].",
        " Results ",
        "This cross-sectional study sample includes 36 elderly individuals (72.28 \u00b1 6.58 years old), both male and female, divided into two groups: the group which has fulfilled the recommendations (N = 16; 53.76 \u00b1 24.39 minutes) and the group that has not fulfilled the recommendations (N = 20; 15.95 \u00b1 7.79 minutes).

The \u201cFunctional Fitness Test\u201d battery (Rikli and Jones) was used to assess the physical and functional autonomy of the elderly [5]. In order to analyse data, descriptive and inferential statistics were used. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to assess normality, whereas the Mann-Whitney test and the t-Test were used for independent samples.",
        " Results ",
        "On average, participants spent more time in sedentary activities than in physical activity. The group which has fulfilled the recommendations on physical activity has achieved better results on almost all physical fitness tests: 30 s chair stand (repetitions), arm curl (repetitions), 6-minute walk test (m), 8-foot up-and-go (s). However, no significant difference was found between the groups.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The results therefore suggest that only 44.4% of the evaluated participants complied with the Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health. Evidence also suggests that the adherence to these guidelines might have a positive influence on the physical fitness of the elderly, particularly muscular strength, endurance and agility, but not flexibility.",

Low VitD levels are associated with numerous disorders including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, among others. Consumers have the general misperception that \u201cvitamin\u201d denotes something harmless and vital, disregarding its potentially harmful effects. Although vitD toxicity is uncommon, case reports attributed to vitD supplementation have raised. Being a fat-soluble vitamin, excessive supplementation may result in body accumulation and toxicity. It increases intestinal calcium absorption and plays a central role in its homeostasis. Thus, most symptoms of toxicity result from hypercalcemia.

Taking more than 4 different medications per day, fear of falling, hearing problems and/or dizziness and the need for help getting up from a chair were correlated to the history of falls, the TUG, the walking speed and the step test (p \u2264 0.05). The sedentary lifestyle and the use of assistive devices were associated with worst performance in the functional tests (p < 0.05) in the Portuguese sample. TUG, 10-meter walking speed test and step test were correlated with exercise self-efficacy.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The incidence of falls is higher than literature has reported and it is inversely associated with the functional capacity of community-dwelling adults aged over 55 years old.

        "Motor development presupposes a set of life-long processes of change. These processes occur mostly during the first years of the child\u2019s life, having each child different developmental rhythms [1]. Motor skills are fundamental to our day-to-day life, representing the key to the child's development [2]. As such, it is important to know the different factors that influence the development of motor skills during childhood. According to bibliography, the presence of siblings may be an important factor, because this relationship provides a basis for learning and socialization opportunities in various contexts [3].",
        " Objective ",
        "The main goal of this study was to verify if there were differences in the development of motor skills (global and fine) through the scales of the PDMS-2, comparing children that have or do not have siblings.",
        " Methods ",
        "In this study 91 children of both sexes participated (30.20 \u00b1 10.56 months).

The aspects that influence children weight status differ according to the parishes they live in - urban centre or peripheric parishes. For example, parents from a significant proportion of overweight or obese children living in the urban centre parishes perceives their neighbourhood environment as unsafe to walk during the day, however, no differences were found between normal and overweight or obese children from the peripheric parishes. This should be held in consideration when developing healthy urban planning strategies.",

There was a significant association between relevant cardiovascular history and veteran athletes. The most frequent cardiovascular diseases in group A were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (19.4%), arterial hypertension (11.1%), left ventricle noncompaction (8.3%) and great vessel transposition (8.3%). Arterial hypertension (50%) and coronary disease (45.4% were the most frequent diseases that disqualified the practice of competition sports in veteran athletes.

Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS software (version 24.0) for a statistical significance of 10%.",
        " Results ",
        "In this study case, only 58.8% (n = 355) of the elementary school children had normal weight, and 41.2% showed overweight/obesity [overweight: 17.0% (n = 103); obesity: 24.2% (n = 146)]. There were no significant statistical differences (p = 0.519) between genders (Mann-Whitney). By age (Kruskal-Wallis), there were significant statistical differences (p = 0.001), specially between the 5 years old (Md=2) [p=0.016 (7 years old; Md=1); p=0.003 (8 years old; Md=1); p=0.021 (9 years old; Md=1)] and the 6 years old (Md=2) [p=0.005 (7 years old; Md=1); p=0.001 (8 years old; Md=1); p=0.013 (9 years old; Md=1)]. For Md interpretation, normal weight is classified by 1, overweight by 2 and obesity by 3. The Spearman test (r) allowed to verify significant statistical correlations, two positive [shuttle run (p=0.001; r=0.136); handgrip (p=0.002; r=0.123)] and three negative [lateral jump (p=0.001; r=-0.174); standing long jump (p=0.001; r=-0.249); throwing velocity (p=0.072; r=-0.073)].",
        " Conclusions ",
        "It is important to take into account the current recommendations and concerns of the WHO [4] (healthy eating habits, physical activity regular practice), improving body composition and motor competence in childhood from an early age, resulting probably in healthier adults and minimizing possible social problems concerning public health.",

        "COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is a chronic and incapacitating disease, characterized by the presence of persistent respiratory symptoms and a gradual decrease in energy [1-3]. The person with COPD has to cope with a complex therapeutic regimen and with the progressive worsening of the clinical condition [3], which may compromise their capacity for self-care. Therefore, people with COPD need support to manage the disease and the therapeutic regimen [4-6].",
        " Objective ",
        "The study aims were to study people with COPD perception about their social support, as well as their level of adherence to medications and to analyse the association between perceived social support and adherence to medication.",

        "This is a quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study, with a sample of 45 adults diagnosed with COPD, admitted to medical service at a hospital in the northern part of Portugal, between February and May 2017. Participants mean age was 71 years (SD = 11.9), they were mostly male (86.7%), married (72.7%) and had a low level of education. The measures used were: a sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, the Social Support Scale (SSS) and Reported Adherence to Medication Scale (RAMS).",

The higher scores were found for the dimension of family and affective support (M = 3.9, SD = 1.0), and the lowest scores were found in the financial support dimension (M = 2.7, SD = 1.0). In relation to the treatment of COPD, most participants reported high adherence levels (M = 12.5, SD = 4.4). A positive association was found between perceived social support and medication adherence (r = 0.46, p = 0.001).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Our results support the importance of social support in adherence to medication, on the person with COPD. The study also suggests the existence of a group of patients more at risk, in terms of lack of social support and non-adherence to medication, pointing out the need to develop nursing interventions focused on the promotion of self-management of COPD.",

        "The organizational commitment (OC) has its origin in the \u201cSide bets\u201d theory, representing the result of the accumulation of bets, which can be lost in a situation where the interruption of an activity occurs [1] The terms are understood as the maintenance of the belonging to the organization, being something of value in which the individual invested [2]. That is, while the individual works, creates bonds, commits himself and goes investing in the organization. The three-dimensional model [3] identifies the three dimensions of OC: the affective commitment, which consists in the feeling or desire to participate in the organization; the continuance commitment, which consists in the obligation to remain in the organization; and finally, the normative commitment, which consists in the worker's need to remain in the organization.",
        " Objective ",
        "The objective of this study is to measure the OC levels, in its several dimensions, on the health professionals (physicians, nurses and auxiliaries) in two public hospitals in Cape Verde, considering the importance of sociodemographic variables (age, gender, marital status and academic qualifications) and Working context (work income, seniority in the company, type of contract and Hierarchical position) for the CO levels revealed.",
        " Methods ",
        "The study used a quantitative methodology to evaluate the impact of sociodemographic and professional context variables on OC levels.

The sample consisted of 224 health professionals.",
        " Results ",
        "The scale presented good levels of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.85), with median OC values correlating positively with age; simultaneously, low OC levels were identified in higher education levels and High values of OC were identified in lower education levels. Finally, OC levels were also significantly higher for the less qualified professionals, auxiliaries showed the highest levels while the doctors showed the lowest levels of OC.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "It is emphasized the positive and statistically significant relationship between age and OC, implying higher OC levels in the higher age groups, as identified in previous studies [5-8]. The inverse relation between OC levels and levels of academic qualifications, as identified by other authors [2-3, 5,8-9], is also a subject of interest. As well as the fact that the lower levels of OC appear in the most qualified professions: doctors and nurses, a not treated aspect in the literature and that characterizes the health professionals of Cape Verde.",

        "Poor sleep quality is associated with increased food intake and poor diet quality [1]. People with lack of sleep show a positive correlation between free time and food intake and also experience hormonal and brain changes that drive the intake of food with high calorific value [1-3]. In addition, scientific research has shown a healthy and balanced diet to positively influence the quality of sleep [1].",

        " Methods ",
        "The study used non-experimental, analytical and transversal methodology, of epidemiological character and with a quantitative approach. It was intended to carry out the study in a population of 862 high school students. However, due to consent being required from both legal guardians and students, a smaller sample of 345 students was obtained. The data was collected in May 2017 through a questionnaire that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), validated for the Portuguese population.",
        " Results ",
        "Throughout the study and following PSQI analysis, it was concluded that 39.71% (n = 137) of participants showed poor quality of sleep (PSQI > 5 points). The correlation between sleep quality and food intake was assessed and a statistically significant association was found between the quality of sleep and the intake of snacks (X2 = 17.144; p = 0.000), sugary products (X2 = 18.603; p= 0 .000), fast-food (X2 = 12.353; p = 0.002) and ready meals (X2 = 14.852; p = 0.000). The risk of suffering from poor sleep quality is higher in young populations who frequently eat snacks ([OR]: 2.811; 99%), sugary products ([OR]: 1.901; 95%), fast-food ([OR]: 4.000; 99%) and ready meals ([OR]: 5.621; 95%) in comparison with young populations who rarely eat this sort of food. The sleep quality is also significantly related with the number of meals young people have in a day (X2 = 7.580; p = 0.023). The risk of having poor quality sleep is 2.240 times higher in young people who rarely eat 4-6 meals a day.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "A correlation between sleep quality and food intake in the sampled students was seen. The risk of having poor quality of sleep is higher in students who frequently eat a high calorie diet and also in students who rarely have 4-6 meals a day. There are several connections between sleep quality and eating habits. Sleep promotion and its connection with standard diets should be included as an essential part of community empowerment for health-promoting lifestyles [1,4,5].",

        "The sample was composed by 294 children between 5-9 years old (M \u00b1 SD = 7.35 \u00b1 1.18 years old; 147 female) of the 10 elementary schools from the \u201cAgrupamento de Escolas de Montemor-o-Velho (AEMMV)\u201d (Coimbra-Portugal). Data was collected from September to December 2017. Family socio-demographic characteristics data were collected using a survey questionnaire applied to parents of participating children. Weight was evaluated using a Tanita Body Composition Monitor (model BC-420 SMA). Height was calculated using a stadiometer. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using the formula weight/height2. The definition of underweight (level 1), normal weight (level 2), overweight (level 3) and obesity (level 4) was based on the tables in use by the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health [5], which correlates BMI with percentile tables.

        "Musculoskeletal pain in children is one of the most common reasons to seek medical attention. The most common musculoskeletal pain conditions are nonspecific or idiopathic and include regional pain in the spine, with a high prevalence [1]. Multifactorial causes are indicated, like social, psychological, physiological and environmental factors [2, 3]. Within the environmental factors, the carriage of schoolbags is pointed out as a factor that contributes to the high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain [3-5]. However, some studies report that the weight of schoolbags has little influence on the perception of pain, mainly in the spine [6, 7]. Nevertheless, musculoskeletal pain in childhood can persist throughout adolescence and increases the risk of experiencing chronic pain in adulthood [8-10]. At this phase, adolescents undergo a period of accelerated muscle-skeletal growth and development, with spinal structures being sensitive to external aggressions [11].",

The majority had backpacks (96.6%) and 82.4% (n = 775) carried the backpack over 2 shoulders. The mean schoolbag weight (4.9 \u00b1 1.3 kg) represented a mean % body weight (%BW) of 13.0% (\u00b1 4.8). Only 29.3% carried schoolbags that were \u2264 10 %BW. The majority (79.9%) carried schoolbags to school for \u2264 15 min. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was reasonable (37.8%), and in the region of spine was low (16.0%). Multiple linear regression model indicated that pain is only explained by the number of hours of physical activity (negative correlation: r = -0.367) in 12.4% (R2 = 0.124; p = 0.001, SEE = 0.143).",

Data were collected during through a self-filling form focusing on socio-demographic variables, sport activities and anthropometric measures (sex, age, house hold composition, practice of at least 60 minutes/week of sport activities outside school, weight, height). A booklet was used during five consecutive days to register food consumption.

        "Preliminary results included 109 school-aged children (mean age = 7.5 years old; mean weight = 28.50 kg; mean height = 131.60 cm). Regarding the Body Mass Index (BMI), 65.1% of the children were considered to have normal weight, 11.9% overweight, and 8.3% obesity; underweight emerged in 14.7% of children. The consumption of fruit/vegetables was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in underweight children when compared with normal weight and overweight/obese children. The average consumption of fat/oil, and sugary/salty products seemed smaller in underweight children and greater in overweight/obese children, while the consumption of dairies/meat/fish/eggs, cereals and their derivatives, tubers and water seemed similar; however, statistically significant differences were not found (p > 0.05). Most children (77.1%) performed at least 60 minutes/week of sport activities outside school (66.7% practice only one type, 25.0% practice two, and 8.3% practice three different sports per week). Food consumption was not significantly different between children that practiced at least 60 min/week of sports outside school comparing to the children who didn\u2019t.",

        "Though most children have normal weight, data show important abnormalities in BMI. The consumption of fruit/vegetables appears to be increased in underweight children and decreased in overweight/obese children, which highlights the need for more detailed research. Food consumption does not seem to differ depending on the practice of outside-school sports. Further stages must bring the development of a transdisciplinary healthcare program to improve healthy lifestyles among school-aged children.",

        "Dating violence is an obvious and worrying social and health problem with serious consequences for its victims. It is characterized as a pattern of coercive and abusive tactics employed by one partner in a relationship to gain power and control over the other partner. It can take many forms, including physical violence, coercion, threats, intimidation, isolation, and emotional, sexual or economic abuse and occurs in the context of intimate heterosexual or homosexual/lesbian relationships. This kind of violence seems to be supported on conservative and traditional gender norms and stereotypes.",
        " Objective ",

Men were identified as the main perpetuators, with women having the highest rates of victimization. With regard to the type of violence perpetuated, psychological and social violence appear as the most experienced by students. With regard to gender social beliefs, this study reveals that these students maintain conservative and traditional gender beliefs that continue to perpetuate violence.

        " Background ",
        "Increasing healthcare costs is a concern of all developed countries. In Long-Term Healthcare (LTH) this is reinforced by population ageing and corresponding prevalence of chronic diseases. Thus, it is fundamental to accurately measure costs and outcomes in healthcare, improving value created for patients, i.e., patient-centred health outcomes per monetary unit of cost [1, 2]. TDABC methodology applied to healthcare allows identifying the cost for each clinical condition in the full cycle of care, mapping processes, activities, resources and allocated time [3\u20135]. It has been mostly applied in acute-care settings, partly due to complexity of defining chronic condition [6].",
        " Objective ",
        "This paper focuses on the cost component of a larger on-going research project (CARE4VALUE), aiming to enhance value creation in LTH providers and applied to a partner LTH unit. Specifically, the main objective is to define clinical conditions in the context of LTH, as a first step in the implementation of TDBAC.",
        " Methods ",
        "Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods were applied, including: 1) three focus groups conducted with the health team of the LTH unit (physician, nurses, physiotherapist, psychologist, social assistant) to select, discuss and validate the criteria to define clinical conditions; 2) construction of a composite indicator and testing it over a sample of anonymized clinical data from 21 patients; 3) structured observation of processes taken throughout the full cycle of care of patients in different conditions. Qualitative data was submitted to content analysis and validated among participants. Quantitative data used in the composite indicator, based on validated scales, was subject to normalization, aggregation and sensitivity analysis.",
        " Results ",
        "One consensual outcome of the focus groups was that, in LTH, the disease or cause of entrance is less relevant to costs than the overall complexity of the patient, entailing psychical, social, spiritual and psychic-mental dimensions. Accordingly, a multidimensional classification model of patients in four complexity levels was delivered, after being validated and receiving consensus from the LTH team. Additionally, it will include a logging tool and dashboard to integrate separate patient-centred information and aid patient classification in complexity conditions.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The completion of this step allowed progressing in the design and implementation of the cost model, which, in turn, will support value measurement, and enhancing of the focus LTH unit. Besides, all involved professionals stated that their engagement in this phase of the project generated exceptional opportunities for interdisciplinary meetings and debate, contributing to closer ties between different areas of LTH.",

Negative feelings related to body weight and shape seem to play a role in eating problems, with some studies suggesting that binge eating may occur as a means of momentarily avoiding/reducing negative affects related to body weight and shape [2, 3]. Recent evidence suggests that positive emotions may also relate to overeating in healthy and obese adults [4-6].

        " Background ",
        "Evidence based practice (EBP) is defined as an integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values in clinical decision making [1, 2]. Research confirms positive outcomes when implementing EBP: patient safety; improved clinical outcomes; reduced healthcare costs and decreased variation in patient outcomes [3]. Considered as a standard of care, EBP has benefits for nurses, patients, general population, health care systems, as well as for research and education. Authors describe several types of obstacles to the use of research in practice: characteristics of the adopter, organization, innovation and communication [1]. Individual barriers include lack of knowledge and how to critique research studies; lack of awareness; colleagues not supportive of practice change and nurses feeling a lack of authority to change practice. Organizational barriers include insufficient time to implement new ideas; lack of access to research; and lack of awareness of available educational tools related to research [3]. The most important factor related to nurses\u2019 EBP is support from their employing organizations to use and conduct research. Programme implementation is most likely to be successful when it matches the values, needs and concerns of practitioners. Concerning the development and implementation of competence for EBP, firstly, is important to identify the barriers.",
        " Objective ",

        " Methods ",
        "This study is part of a larger one, namely: \u201cClinical Supervision for Safety and Care Quality\u201d (C-S2AFECARE-Q). To answer our research question a convenience sampling strategy was employed to distribute 500 questionnaires to nurses working in a central hospital in the north of Portugal. Data was collected between April and July 2017. They returned 260 questionnaires, 98 of these with the answer to the following question: \u201cIn your opinion, which are the barriers for the implementation of EBP in your context?\u201d. Data analyses were based on content analysis proposed by Bardin (1977).",
        " Results ",
        "Barriers were allocated into categories: Organization; Leaders and Management; Professionals and evidence [4]. Nurses reported perceived barriers in all these levels. In the organization\u2019 barrier, they identified lack of organizational culture; lack of support from management and outdated and unquestioned routines. They also reported insufficient support from the leaders. In individual terms, they identified negative attitudes, such as lack of motivation, resistance to change, lack of time and inadequate knowledge and skills.",

        "In a 580-bed adult teaching hospital, between January and December 2017, on random days of each month, patients were audited for identification by wristband by a team of nurses with experience in clinical audit.",
        " Results ",
        "In the 12 months studied, 161 audits were performed, resulting in 3,539 patients audited. From the total patients audited, 3,406 (96.2%) were correctly identified with wristbands. There were 133 failures: 113 patients had no identification wristband, 19 patients had an identification wristband, but the name was unreadable and 1 patient had a wristband with the wrong name. The rate of correctly identified patients increased progressively over the months: in the first month (January 2017) 89.3% of patients were correctly identified with a wristband; in December 2017, the rate of correctly identified patients was 95.0%.

A low percentage (6.6%) had already suffered from a psychiatric disease, mainly humour disorders (4.1%) and 37.6% had regular contact with a patient with mental illness in their lives. The sample had medium-low levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness (Mean=122.72; SD=5.19), being these negative attitudes more relevant in authoritarianism (Mean=24.17; SD=4.34) and social restriction (Mean=20.53; SD=4.93) areas.

        " Objective ",
        "This study aims to explore differences in QoL between individuals with cognitive impairment and chronic mental illness, attending supported employment services given by the Centre of Resources for Employment and Open Labour Market Inclusion. Moreover, from baseline to 6 months, the outcomes from individuals self-reported QOL will be analysed.",
        " Methods ",
        "The sample was composed by adults (N = 169; 52.1% women and 47.9% men), aged 18-64 years-old, with a mean age of 41.34 (SD = 11.33), who attended supported employment services. All participants had a previous diagnosis of cognitive impairment and/or chronic mental illness. QoL was assessed by WHOQOL-Bref (N=169 at baseline; N=51 at 6 months follow-up).",
        " Results ",
        "Results from independent t-test revealed significant gender and age differences between individuals QoL, with men reporting better physical and psychological QoL when compared to women. Younger participants (age \u2264 40 years-old) also presented better QoL (in all domains, except in social relations) when compared to older participants. All differences reflected small to moderate effect sizes. Overall QoL, as well as its physical and environmental dimensions were significantly and negatively associated with participants\u2019 age. Finally, after attending six-months of supported employment services 29.4% of participants increased global QoL, 35.3% increased their physical and psychological QoL, 37.3% showed an improvement in their social relationships and 55% reported feeling better in their environment.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Overall, results suggest that individuals with cognitive impairment and chronic mental illness, attending supported employment services, have perceived a positive QoL at the 6-month follow-up. As the supported employment services are still on-going, future studies would have to be conducted to explore results in a larger sample and to measure impact in people\u2019s health and living conditions.",

        "The preschool years represent a critical time period for the development of children\u2019s executive functioning and socio-emotional competences [1] and therefore it is the ideal period for the stimulation of these competencies [2, 3]. Interventions with children in preschool age should privilege spontaneity, creativity and play as a method of learning and stimulation [4, 5]. Psychomotor therapy and Creative Dance are two therapeutic approaches based on these principles [5, 6]. However, to date, no research has been done comparing the effects of Psychomotor therapy and Creative Dance.",

An experimental group participated in 24 Psychomotor therapy sessions, mainly involving sensorimotor activities and games with rules. The other experimental group participated in 24 Creative Dance sessions. The control group maintained daily life activities. Cold executive functions, hot executive functions, externalized and internalized behaviours and aggressiveness were evaluated.",

This study was approved by the National Data Protection Commission and the ethics committee of the hospital where the study was conducted (n\u00ba 24/2017).",
        " Results ",
        "The majority of dependent-persons were female (60.6%) with a mean age of 81.6 \u00b1 11.3 years old, with the majority being dependent on all self-care activities. The mean age of caregivers was 61.4 \u00b1 12.1 years old, mainly females. The family relationship was mostly a son/daughter (39.4%) or a spouse (33.3%), taking care of the patient on average at 63.9 \u00b1 .93 months. It was possible to verify that all caregivers had previous experience of caregiving to a family dependent. We also verified that the 33 caregivers presented a mean of 53.9 \u00b1 15.8 on the emotional burden scale (maximum possible value of 110) which corresponds to little burden. We can also mention that 30.3% of the caregivers present no burden, 30.3%, present mild burden and 39.4% present intense burden. Regarding the relationship between caregiver burden, we verified that higher levels of informal caregivers burden were related to lower levels of perception of their competence to satisfy the needs related to the hygiene of the dependent-person (rs=.-0.514; p> 0.05).",

        "Caring of a dependent-person may lead to health risks to the caregiver. Even though the sample size is small, it was possible to verify that a considerable number of caregivers presented intense emotional burden. Therefore, it is necessary that health professionals develop interventions to prevent caregiver burden.",

Results show that nurses mostly indicated the use of two strategies to deal with conflict: accommodation (M= 3.11) and confrontation (M= 3.07). Data analysis revealed that the strategy of accommodation had a statistically significant positive correlation coefficient in relation with the incompatibility of personalities (rs= 0.400, p < 0.05) and a negative correlation coefficient in relation with the scarcity of material (rs= -0.358, p < 0.05) as cause of conflict.",

The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding at 4 months was predicted only by the weight of the new-born (bpequeno para a idade gestacional=4.821; X2wald(1)= 21.616; p < 0.001; OR=124.038).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "In this study, only the type of delivery had significant statistical influence for the initiation of breastfeeding in the first half hour of life. We also found that the initiation of breastfeeding in the first two hours of life did not predict its prevalence at four months.",

        " Background ",
        "Understanding the factors underlying the public health problem of Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is a pressing need. Research show that body image-related shame memories are significantly associated with the severity of binge eating symptomatology in women with Binge Eating Disorder (BED) [1]. These individuals may eat as a means to temporarily avoid or reduce negative emotions related to body weight and shape [2, 3]. Evidence suggests that body image flexibility (i.e., the ability to accept and fully experience body image-related internal experiences - thoughts, emotions, memories - when doing so is consistent with valued-living [4], may deter the engagement in emotional eating [5].",
        " Objective ",
        "The current study examined the moderator effect of body image flexibility on the association between shame memories and emotional eating in a sample of women with BED.",
        " Methods ",
        "109 women with the diagnosis of BED participated in this study. Mean (SD) participants age was 37.39 (10.51) years and BMI was 33.69 (7.75) kg/m2. Participants were assessed through the Eating Disorder Examination 17.0D, the Shame Experiences Interview (SEI) and filled self-report measures assessing the centrality of the recalled shame memories, emotional eating and body image flexibility.",
        " Results ",
        "Descriptive statistics showed that body image-related shame memories were the most frequently recalled memories. Correlational analysis revealed that the extent to which the recalled shame memory is central to identity is significantly associated with emotional eating. Body image flexibility was negatively associated with the centrality of the recalled shame memory and emotional eating. Results of the moderation analysis showed that body image flexibility significantly moderate the association between the centrality of the recalled shame memory and emotional eating. This suggests that patients with BED with a greater trait-like ability to accept body image-related negative internal experiences, present a lower tendency to use food as a form of experiential avoidance.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Findings support a conceptual integrative model of binge eating symptomatology that clarifies the role that contextual and interpersonal variables play in the development and persistence of difficulties in regulating eating behaviour in BED, and how body image flexibility may have a protective role in these associations. These results also have important clinical implications supporting the relevance of contextual-behavioural interventions that address the role of shame memories, body image difficulties and that help patients to develop body image flexibility.",

        "To measure Psychological Welfare and validate the constructs of 42 items of the Psychological Welfare Scale.",
        " Methods ",
        "Quantitative, exploratory and cross study was used as methodology. A convenience sample was performed with 252 participants. The measuring instrument was developed using the Qualtrics program. The study had favourable appreciation and consent from the College Nursing of Porto (ESEP) that provided a computer platform that allowed the participants to access to the measurement instrument. The construct in analysis in this study was developed by Ryff [2] and intended to measure Psychological Welfare on six scales: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Originally, each subscale was composed of 20 items, but the author suggested smaller versions, preferably the version of seven items per subscale. Respondents rated statements on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 indicating strong disagreement and 6 indicating strong agreement. Participants are, on average, 31.38 years old (SD=12.88) and 81% are female. The analysis of the items of the scale was performed through item descriptive analysis, confirmatory factorial analysis, internal consistency analysis of each subscale and factorial validity using AMOS (version 22, IBM SPSS).",
        " Results ",
        "The descriptive analysis of the items showed that the response tendency is above the midpoint. In the analysis of the adaptation of the theoretical model to the empirical model, we verified that the model constituted by a factor with six manifested variables resulting from the sum of the seven items of each subscale showed good indexes of adjustment. The internal consistency values of each subscale ranged from 0.69 to 0.82 suggesting a reasonable to good internal consistency. All correlations showed significant values at the 0.01 level.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The values found suggest that the concepts of the subscales of the measuring instrument are related but without any redundancy of measurements. The Psychological Welfare Scale is a theoretically grounded instrument which specifically focuses on measuring multiple facets of psychological welfare. We consider this Scale of Psychological Welfare to be a valid and reliable tool to measure psychological welfare in a Portuguese context.",

The experimental group underwent a 12-week Sportive Blowgun program, with 2 weekly sessions where each subject threw 40 darts at a distance that progressed from 4m to 10m away from the target. Maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) values (L/min) were collected through a Micro Medical - Micro RPM portable spirometer. Five measurements were taken for both groups.

There is a significant difference between the values of the initial measurement with all other measurements, suggesting a positive evolution between them. There is only no significant difference between the intermediate measurements, which suggests a stagnation of the values between the second, third and fourth measurements. In the control group, except for the second measurement, there was no significant difference between the initial maximal expiratory pressure and the other measurements, which suggests that there was an initial adaptation to the test but that did not last. Comparing groups, except for the first measurement, all the others present a significant difference.

However, studies about older adults seem to be scarcer [4\u20137], particularly studies focused on whether or not faller and non-faller older adults can accurately perceive affordances for a stepping forward task.",
        " Objective ",
        "The purpose of this study was to determine if older people could accurately perceive affordances for the task of stepping forward. The relationship between real and estimated maximum distance was explored in community-dwelling older adults, comparing fallers with non-fallers.",

        "A sample of 347 community-dwelling older adults (age 73.02 \u00b1 6.40 yr; non-fallers: 57.9%, fallers: 42.1%) with the absence of cognitive impairment participated in the study. Participants were asked to predict their maximum distance for a stepping forward prior to performing the task. Absolute Percent Error (APE), Absolute Error (AE) and Error Tendency (ET) were calculated accordingly (2.8). APE measured deviation percentage from accurate perceptions, AE indicated the discrepancy (in cm) between estimation and real performance. ET indicated the direction of the error (under- or overestimation bias).",
        " Results ",
        "On average, non-faller estimated (63.7 \u00b1 15.5 cm) and performed (70.7 \u00b1 14.9 cm) greater distances than faller (estimation: 57.1 \u00b1 14.5 cm; real: 61.7 \u00b1 14.6 cm) older adults. No statistically significant differences were observed in APE (fallers: 7.2 \u00b1 12.4 %; non-fallers: 9.6 \u00b1 12.5 %). However, differences in AE were significant between faller (6.7 \u00b1 5.9 cm) and non-faller (9.6 \u00b1 12.5 cm) older adults (p = .001). Old people had a huge tendency to underestimate (77.2%) the maximum distance achieved in a stepping forward. The results show a significant association between ET and being faller (\u03c72(1) =6.407, p=.01). Despite general participants exhibit an underestimation tendency, this tendency is greater in non-fallers (61.6% vs 38.4%). Further, there were fewer non-fallers than fallers overestimating their ability to step forward (45.6% vs 54.4%).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Older adults displayed a tendency to underestimate the maximum distance they can stepping-forward. The bias of overestimation is more frequent in fallers, whereas persons who underestimated tend to do not fall, suggesting that they have a protective behaviour which avoids falls. Data evidence that older adults can perceive what the environment affords, which is in agreement with an ecological perspective to perception and action.",

Participants judged their maximum stepping-forward distance prior to the performance of the estimated task. Absolute Error (AE) [|estimated \u2013 real|] (cm) and Absolute Percent Error (APE) (%) were computed, and the Error Tendency (ET) was classified (underestimation vs. overestimation) [5, 6].",
        " Results ",
        "Univariate binary regression analysis showed that all the described variables explain significantly fall occurrence (p < 0.05). Data showed that, for each additional cm estimated in the stepping-forward test, the likelihood of falling decreased on 2.9%, OR: 0.971 (95%CI: 0.957-0.986), and for each additional cm performed in the test, this likelihood decreased on 4.0%, OR: 0.960 (95%CI: 0.945-0.975). Furthermore, data showed that for each additional cm computed as AE, the likelihood of falling decreased on 3.6%, OR: 0.964 (95%CI: 0.933-0.996), and for each additional 1% computed as APE this likelihood decreased on 0.9%, OR: 0.991 (95%CI: 0.969-1.013). Finally, data showed that subjects reporting an ET of underestimation were less 47.7% likely for falling, OR: 0.523 (95%CI: 0.315-0.867), than subjects showing an ET of overestimation.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The new stepping-forward affordance perception test evidenced to be useful to determine the risk of fall occurrence. A higher estimation of maximum distance achieved or a higher real performance on the test were associated with a lower risk of falling. Further, a higher AE and an underestimation tendency showed to be associated with a decreased risk of falling. This suggests that is the marge of security provided by the higher performance ability, in contrast with a lower perception of affordance, which is protective and avoids falls.",

The measurement instruments consisted on a questionnaire and on the use of the KINOVEA software for movement analysis. The questionnaire contained questions about the socio-demographic characteristics of the population and about the occurrence of low back pain (at the moment, over a 12-month period and during all surfing practice). Surfers were demarcated with a tape on D8 and at the base of the sacrum. Surfers were filmed while performing the paddling movement, in the sea, using their own boards.

An important body of research has focused on resilience in relation to trauma [8-11], nevertheless, studies regarding long-term consequences and adaptive functioning are still scarce [12]. Efforts seem to focus more on preventing relatively immediate severe symptoms of psychopathology [13, 14] rather than on promoting long-term psychological adjustment.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Research aimed at understanding the long-term psychological effects of exposure to disasters, looking at individuals who showed and did not show psychopathology following that incident seems a sensible topic to be developed. Aiming to understand how individuals in different life stages deal with adversity and to design interventions able to support individuals in dealing with the less visible long-term effects of trauma is equally important. In addition, to focusing on the absence of psychopathology, researchers should have in mind the promotion of positive development throughout the life-span.",
        "Researchers should develop measures that assess exposure to disaster/trauma, taking into consideration not only the type of event, dates and duration, but also the type of exposure and involved stressors, attempting to capture disaster exposure in its complexity. At the same time, research should acknowledge the importance of the meaning that individuals attribute to an event and its consequences, more than the event itself [2, 3], and consider perceived individual, family and community resources in relation to it.",

        " Background ",
        "Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving language deficits in the absence of other associated condition [1]. The aetiology of SLI is hotly debated, ranging from representational deficits in grammar to impairments in the cognitive processes that underlie language acquisition. Recent research suggests that SLI difficulties may arise from implicit learning (IL) deficits, i.e. impairments in the cognitive mechanisms that allow children to extract the structural regularities present in the input and to generalize it to new contexts [2]. IL studies have been conducted mainly with adults and unimpaired children using the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT). The few studies conducted with language impaired children produced inconsistent results [3]. Since performance of this task involves a motor component that seems to be also impaired in SLI, it is critical to conduct studies using other tasks and paradigms.",
        " Objective ",
        "To analyse if IL deficits are core in SLI using an Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) task. The AGL task is particularly suited to study IL deficits in SLI because it mimics language acquisition more closely than SRTT and, in addition, avoids its motor component. In an AGL task, participants are firstly exposed to strings that conform the rules of an artificial-grammar (learning-phase). Then, they are asked to decide whether new strings conform or not these rules (test-phase). Performance is typically better to grammatical (G) than to non-grammatical (NG) strings, indicating that participants learned the grammar even without consciousness of it.",
        " Methods ",
        "Fourteen Portuguese children participated in this study (Mage=4.86, SD=.66), 7 with a SLI diagnosis matched in age, sex, and non-verbal IQ with other 7 children with typical development (TD). All children were asked to perform a visual AGL task presented as a computer game. Written consent was obtained from all parents.",
        " Results ",
        "Results showed that TD children outperformed SLI children in the test-phase. More hits were also observed for the G strings that revealed higher- than lower-similarity with the strings presented in the learning-phase. Furthermore, the analysis of children performance showed that while TD children revealed an increased number of correct responses and a decreased number of attempts to achieve a correct response in the learning-phase, SLI children did not.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Children with SLI reveal deficits in their IL abilities as indexed by a worse performance both in the learning and test phases of a visual AGL task. IL malfunctioning should be considered in the aetiology of the disorder.",

        "Health-disease processes experienced by children and youth, and their families, are often associated with intense emotionality and, simultaneously, entails a great emotional challenge for nurses in their care, requiring emotional labour of triple centrality: on the client, nurse and nurse-client relationship [1]. Nurses perform this emotional labour according to their personal resources and learning from the day-to-day experience of care [2]. Moreover, this emotional dimension of nursing care continues to be undervalued by health institutions, and by nurses themselves, so that emotional labour is not always the object of reflection and/or support in scientific evidence [3]. For this reason, conceptual models are needed to guide and strengthen nurses in their practice, especially when the context is peculiar as in paediatric care.",
        "Diogo [1], presented an explanatory hypothesis of the process of therapeutic use of emotions in paediatric nursing, arguing that Emotional Labour in Paediatric Nursing translates into actions of positive transformation of emotional experience into interactions of care with the paediatric client, through five categories of intervention: 1) Promoting a safe and affectionate environment; 2) Nurturing care with affection; 3) To facilitate client emotional management; 4) to build stability in the relationship; 5) to regulate their own emotional disposition to care. This Emotional Labour Model in Paediatric Nursing was developed based on the nursing paradigm of transformation [4] whose central concept is Caring, supported by the Watson's Human Care theory [5], and theorizes about \u201cpersonal knowing\u201d [6]. This Model also integrates the principles of family-centred care and non-traumatic care in Paediatric Nursing, such as the holistic and humanized perspective on health. At the heart of the proposed Model is the Emotional Labour of Nursing conception [2].",

        "Oxygen is recognised as an essential element in the wound healing process and, it is suggested that the topical application of oxygen may be a promising therapy in wound care. Thus, the importance of oxygen in the tissue healing process is evident, namely in ATP synthesis; production of reactive oxygen species, which stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor synthesis; and microbial growth inhibition through the promotion of macrophage chemotaxis and increase of leukocyte activity. Moreover, oxygen increases the rate of collagen deposition, an important step in healing, which supplies the matrix for angiogenesis and tissue maturation. Thus, according to the P.I.C.O. review model for clinical questions, this systematic review intends to answer the research question \u201cIn chronic wounds, how does topical oxygen therapy affects wound healing?\u201d. It was considered chronic wounds for \u201cpatient population or disease of interest\u201d, topical oxygen therapy for \u201cintervention or issue of interest\u201d and wound healing for \u201coutcome\u201d. However, a \u201ccomparison intervention or group\u201d and a \u201ctime frame\u201d were not applicable.",

        "The studies analysed emphasise the evidence of additional O2 usage in wound care, since it reduces hypoxia and it allows triggering mechanisms which are essential for the healing process. The analysed literature presents the results of its effects in its various forms: pressurized, continuous and dissolved. Although there are still questions about the exact mechanisms of this treatment and it is necessary to carry out randomised studies, the current results suggest that this therapy plays an important role in restoring the O2 balance in the wound bed, necessary for healing.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "These findings show the potential of this therapy in promoting healing of chronic wounds and improving people\u2019s quality of life.

        " Methods ",
        "A retrospective descriptive study was performed using database records from a northern laboratory. The microbiological parameters studied to characterize the inland bathing waters included CFU/100mL of E.coli and CFU/100mL of intestinal Enterococcus. The results were classified as \u201cBad\u201d, \u201cAcceptable\u201d, \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cExcellent\u201d, according to the Decree-Law 135/2009 of June 3rd [1].",

        "We verified that in the total of 26 inland bathing waters under study, 6 (23.1%) obtained a quality equal to or greater than \u201cAcceptable\u201d. The remaining 20 bathing waters (76.9%) were classified as \u201cBad\u201d. This result, in 17 samples was due to both parameters, intestinal Enterococcus and E. coli. In the other three, the \u201cBad\u201d classification was only due to the Enterococcus results. The months with the highest counts of E. coli were September (45.69%), June (43.30%) and May (39.62%), and for Enterococcus were May (52.83%), June (52.58%) and July (32.35%).",

        "In an initial study and applying criteria that will then have to be more extended in terms of time, there is a first tendency for most of the inland bathing waters under study to present \u201cBad\u201d quality (76.90%). Since all bathing waters should have at least \u201cAcceptable\u201d quality and provisional data, these results indicate an urgent need to take measures in order to counteract this and increase the number of bathing waters classified as \u201cExcellent\u201d or \u201cGood.\u201d The different E.coli and intestinal Enterococcus counts observed in different months showed that climatic, environmental, social and urban factors could be involved in this differences and deserves attention in future studies [2, 4]. The quality of bathing water is fundamental in terms of public health. In this sense, the results of this study are worrisome, however these studies should be conducted in a longer time perspective.",

        "Depression is a huge burden requiring efficient strategies for prevention and treatment [1]. Psychoeducation can improve health literacy and help to reduce the stigma of help-seeking. In recent years, the Internet has been suggested as a way to deliver mental health interventions to a broader range of persons and to reduce barriers to seek help from face-to-face services. However, little is known about the effectiveness of digital psychoeducational interventions on health literacy and psychological outcomes, such as help-seeking intentions [2].",
        " Objective ",
        "To derive practical implications for health professionals, this scoping review aimed to explore the effectiveness of different digital psychoeducational interventions strengthening depression literacy or knowledge (primary outcome), stigmatizing attitudes and on help-seeking attitudes, intentions and behaviour (secondary outcomes). This review is conceptualized as an update and expansion of previous research [2] with a focus on a broad range of interventions.",
        " Methods ",
        "In May 2017, a systematic search through electronic databases (e.g. PsycINFO and PSYNDEX) was performed to identify longitudinal studies on the effectiveness of digital interventions targeting depression-related mental health literacy among adults published between 2007 and 2017 in peer-reviewed English journals.",
        " Results ",
        "Overall, 19 Studies met the inclusion criteria, mostly stemming from Australia. The findings of 13 of the included 17 studies evaluating mental health literacy revealed significant increases in depression literacy. Pure dissemination of information via websites, e-mails or psychoeducational interventions yielded primarily positive findings. Both Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and online game programs were found to be knowledge-enhancing, except for one study using a simulated dialogue. Findings on digital intervention targeting stigmatization in terms of individual, as well as perceived attitudes towards mental illness were inconsistent. Concerning perceived stigma, 4 of 8 studies showed positive results in reducing stigma, whereas other results were inconsistent. Likewise, the effects of interventions on help-seeking (n= 8 studies) with respect to attitudes (n= 5 studies), intentions (n= 6 studies) and behaviour (n= 4 studies) were inconclusive.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The evidence base on mental health literacy interventions is promising, but still limited. Various digital interventions are overall comparably effective in strengthening depression literacy and reducing stigmatizing attitudes. Given several limitations, future research should compare subpopulations to understand what works are best for whom in clinical practice. Furthermore, the comparability of knowledge levels of healthy and depressed persons should be considered. Finally, eHealth literacy of clients and health professionals should be explored and, where required, promoted with evidence-based information.",

        "The concept of frailty has been presented in the literature in a variety of ways [1-5] and in close relation with negative health outcomes, such as gait difficulty, falls and weight loss [1, 5]. The correct assessment of frailty in the elderly and the design of an adequate care plan is essential for the provision of personalized care and assistance to caregivers [1-3]. Recent studies associate this concept with physical resilience, as a personal characteristic that determines the capacity to resist functional decline or restore physical health, being a central aspect in active aging [6].",

        " Results ",
        "Fragility, although a significant syndrome linked to the natural aging process, can be modified [2]. The contextual factors of each person, if well evaluated and controlled, can improve functionality not only physically but also cognitively and socially. Interventions that reduce vulnerability and adverse outcomes reduce the risk of hospitalization. The ability of an elderly person to withstand external stress is strongly related to the physiological reserve [5-6]. Taking into account that one of the main components of the fragility phenotype is sarcopenia, many of the interventions must be operationalized in order to prevent it [6]. The phenomenon of loss of functionality and muscle mass is not an isolated phenomenon [5] and produces negative functional outcomes such as difficulty in climbing stairs, getting up from a chair or bed and lifting heavy objects. The optimization of physical resilience can happen through the design of programs of physical exercise, nutrition, therapeutic reconciliation, psychoeducational support and support by health professionals.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Physical resilience is also influenced by factors common to frailty. The main constraint of physical resilience that affects fragility is the physiological reserve. Resilience can be quantified in three ways by determining functional trajectories: \u201cresilient\u201d (without functional changes after adverse events) or \u201cresilient\u201d (functional decline with subsequent recovery) by Physical Resilience levels: \u201cfragile phenotype\u201d vs \u201crobust phenotype\u201d and by determining \u201cchronological age\u201d versus \u201cbiological age\u201d.

The results obtained by the panel of experts allowed us to conclude that all the parameters are relevant to the evaluation of swallowing and important to determinate a safe feeding for each case (CVI>0.80). Thus, by applying the PSAND, it was possible to study two groups: \u201cPenetration\u201d (13 patients) and \u201cAspiration\u201d (5 patients). There were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the two groups for the variables: dependent or independent feeding; poor oral control; lot of residues; reduction of laryngeal sensitivity; leaking of the bolus and difficulty in cleaning pharyngeal residues.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "In summary, we can say that the application of this protocol is an asset to diagnose the presence of dysphagia in any clinical diagnosis, evaluate the swallowing function, verifying the risk of penetration and aspiration and classifying the Dysphagia Severity.",

        "Population aging and the increasing longevity of older people are increasingly relevant worldwide phenomena [1]. In addition, along with ageing, a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity among the elderly is also occurring [2,3].",
        " Objective ",
        "To estimate the increase in the number of obese individuals, due exclusively to population aging in Brazil from 2014 to 2030.",
        " Methods ",
        "The number of obese adult Brazilians was obtained by extrapolation of the prevalence estimated by VIGITEL (Surveillance System for Risk and Protection Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Inquiry) [4] in Brazilian capitals, in 2014, for the entire Brazilian population. The population projection for 2030 by age groups was obtained from IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) [5]. The prevalence obtained by VIGITEL in 2014 was applied to population projections by 2030, maintaining all other variables constant, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).",
        " Results ",
        "The Brazilian adult population (18 +years) corresponded to 144.5 million people in 2014 of whom 15.5 million (10.7%) were 65 years of age or older. Obese adults accounted for 25.9 million (95% CI 24.9-27.0 million) of the entire adult population (17.9%), of which 3.1 million (95% CI 2.8-3.3 million) were elderly obese. The obese elderly corresponded to 11.9% of adults with obesity. In 2030, it is estimated that the Brazilian adult population will reach 175.2 million people, of whom 30.0 million (17.1%) are elderly. Obese will correspond to 31.4 million (95% CI 30.1-32.8 million) of adult Brazilians of whom 5.9 million (95% CI 5.4-6.4 million) will be obese elderly. That is, exclusively due to aging, it is expected an increase of 5.5 million obese for the entire population. An estimated 2.8 million more are obese in the age group of 65 and over. Therefore, it is expected that the percentage of 11.9% of elderly among obese adults in 2014 will rise to 18.9% in 2030.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Considering only the effect of aging with current levels of obesity prevalence, it is estimated that there will be an increase of almost 3 million obese people in Brazil by 2030. The impact of the increase in prevalence itself was not considered, which would make the prospect even more worrying due to the impact on chronic non-communicable diseases and in the use of health services.",

        "Delirium is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric syndromes in the hospital setting, preferably in the elderly debilitated patients. It is a cognitive alteration of sudden onset, developing in a matter of hours or days; which is interspersed with periods of lucidity and also characterized by disturbances in attention, memory and behaviour. It is also identified by the worsening of the symptoms at night and by changes in the sleep-wake cycle. The presence of this syndrome, makes impossible a holistic care, upsetting an effectively communication, between patient and nurse or family. It may even be considered common for an elderly, given the age, to appear confused, but it should not be considered normal, so investing in concrete studies to specify these mental changes and determinate what interventions are more appropriate for this vulnerable group, is emergent. It is up to nurses, who are in a privileged position, the early recognition/intervention at this neurological condition. It is assumed as an emerging need, to implement non-pharmacological strategies, so that the occurrence of delirium decreases and thus avoids great suffering.",

From the literature, it emerges that the family of the person hospitalized in a critical illness has experiences and needs consequent to this situation, in which it is necessary an intervention from the professionals to support/to encourage during this traumatic transition of the familiar life [2]. The family has its own needs, and these must be met to effectively manage the situation of instability of the family member. Since the family directly influences the evolution of a person's condition in a critical illness situation, it is important to see the family also as a target of care, in a holistic view of caring [3]. The main areas of need experienced by the family are: information on the clinical situation, assurance of patient safety, support by health professionals and willingness to be close to the patient [2].",

        "Subjects from the interior region of Portugal, swimming pool users, completed a questionnaire consisting of 33 questions. Those questions were focused on the characterization of their usual in-water activities, and main motivations.",
        " Results ",
        "Until now, 418 swimming pool users answered the questions, ranging from 18 to 79 years old (44.7% females, 55.3% males). Most of them were active and only 67 subjects were retired from work. They used to practice aquatic actives for more than 2 years (60%), and the majority twice-a-week, preferring the evening time to attend the swimming pool. Among the various types of swimming pool use, it was verified that 31% perform water aerobics, 48% swimming classes and 31% free time schedules. More than half of the sample only performed aquatic activities (54%) and aimed to improve health (47%), physical fitness (31%) and 11% to relief stress. Curiously, only 1% wanted to learn how to swim. They classified the physical activities performed in-water in the last few weeks mostly of moderated/vigorous intensity. People who attend to swimming pools are persistent and committed with aquatic exercitation, practicing for more than two years. Although most of them participate in swimming or water aerobics lessons, there is still a considerable number of free-time users and swimming pools must be prepared for this fact. Interestingly, the majority attend to swimming pool to improve health and physical fitness.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This pilot study will be implemented in several other regions of the country and this would allow to understand the motivations and needs of users and to improve offers and support to other areas of research (i.e., development of technological devices).",

Noise has an overall negative impact on patients\u2019 recovery. Identification and dissemination of strategies to reduce environmental noise empowers nurses towards changes in their professional practice.",
        " Objective ",
        "Identify evidence in Literature of nursing care strategies to reduce environmental noise in critical patient care. Methods",
        "This research was conducted in two phases. 1st Phase: Mediated by an integrative literature review (16/04/2017) we carried out data-base research through the Academic Search Complete; Complementary Index; CINAHL Plus with Full Text; Directory of Open Access Journals; Supplemental Index; Psychology and Behavioural; Sciences Collection; SPORTDiscus with Full Text; RCAAP; SciELO; Europeana; Business Source Complete; Education Source; IEEE Xplore Digital Library; MedicLatina; JSTOR Journals; PsycARTICLES; ScienceDirect.

        " Results ",
        "We have identified 6 feasible categories for environmental noise reduction, which we present as main strategies: Behavioural changes (creation of awareness to the importance of the tone of voice and silent handling of equipment and materials); Material and Equipment management (mobile phones, televisions and radios volume configuration; determination of correct parameters for alarm configuration); Management of silence promotion care (implementation of periods of silence, avoid noisy tasks); Training in environmental noise (behavioural change programs and health education about negative effects of noise); Care quality control (usage of ear plugs); Others (infrastructural adaptations, encourage suppliers to produce more silent products).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This study systematizes strategies to be implemented by nursing professionals in order to reduce environmental noise within health structures and improve patient comfort. The implementation of a silence culture enables an adequate and essential physical environment to patient recovery [3]. Empower nurses with the identified strategies allows the improvement of people\u2019s quality of life. The shortage of published research reflects the need of forward research.",

        " Methods ",
        "Qualitative study. Data collection through open interview to 12 family members, of an adult person hospitalized in ICU. The interviews content analysis was carried out according to the phenomenological approach suggested by Van Manen. The Software used for qualitative data analysis was Nvivo. This software showed the advantages of time saving and allowed to carefully explore the relationship between the data [7].",
        " Results ",
        "Family members recognized how determinate the interaction with nurses to their daily life in the ICU was. They reported the careful construction of discourse and the effective presence with the sick person as nurses' strategy for interaction. The need to know better the situation and to discover what will happen, motivated families to start the interaction. Trust was revealed in founded solicitude and compassion. Families know that nurses are vulnerable to their suffering. During interaction, family members noticed that clinical competence is inherent to the nurse person and not related to the time of practice.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The co-existence compromises nurses and family in the construction of an effective therapeutic partnership. They recognized that the information they have from the sick person, arising from different circumstances, must be shared, considering professional ethics, beliefs and values and also the relevance for the therapeutic process. It is in interaction and for the interaction that they discover vulnerability, comfort and trust each other.",

However, the majority of validation studies with the FES-I are conducted with independent and relatively healthy community-dwelling older people, which limits extrapolation to those receiving adult day care services. Reference to higher disability and frailty is common among adult day care users compared to non-users.",

        "The nursing assistant (NA) plays an important role in maintaining the health and independency of institutionalized older adults (OA) [1]. These professionals are required to help OA to achieve and maintain their highest level of function. The Function-Focused Care (FFC) is a philosophy of care that promotes the restoration and/or maintenance of physical function. In the institutional context it is relevant empowering NA to adopted this philosophy [2].",
        " Objective ",
        "This study intends to analyse the perception of NA in relation to the FFC, through scales of self-efficacy, outcomes expectations and knowledge, as well as, the validity and reliability related properties.",
        " Methods ",
        "Quantitative approach of a descriptive/correlational cross-sectional type. A self-report questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic and professional variables and the scales of self-efficacy, expectations and knowledge were applied. Further details about the scales used can be found in Costa [3]. The validation/reliability procedures for each scale consisted in the calculation of exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and in the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for test/retest purposes. Correlation between the scales themselves, with feelings related to the care of elderly, and sociodemographic and professional variables were tested using the Spearman Rank test.",
        " Results ",
        "The sample consisted of 73 NA (100% women) with a mean age of 46.4 (\u00b1 9.9) years from 5 different institutions. The scale of the self-efficacy showed a three-factor model with the total variance of 73.4%, Cronbach's alpha = 85.2% and ICC = 0.80. The scale of outcomes expectations presented one factor, Cronbach's alpha= 95.2% and ICC = 0.97. The scale of Knowledge obtained a percentage of correct answers only of 44.7%. It was not possible to develop predictive models to relate these scales in a pre-intervention situation. Also, the low correlation between the scales and feelings related to the care of OA (difficulty, gratification, physical overload and emotional overload) or sociodemographic and professional variables (age, years of experience, and self-knowledge), indicated a weak dependence between them. Finally, the institution variable showed not to be a confounding variable (that is, does not influence these results).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The Portuguese version of the scales analysed showed satisfactory data validity and reliability. These results suggest that the Portuguese version of these scales can be used to evaluate the FFC performed by the NA. These results point to the importance of implementing a FFC program in the institutions and analyse its impact on AO care and on NA.",

However, it is also known that the various existing oral antidiabetic agents may trigger a large number of adverse events, either alone or in combination. Some of these tolerability and security issues related to the oral antidiabetic are reported by patients and can influence negatively or satisfaction with treatment or glycaemic control, or the therapeutic adherence and maintenance. It is therefore very important the role of patients in monitoring of adverse events related to the use of the oral antidiabetic drugs in order to optimize treatment and improve the quality of life of patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2).",

        "In the period of free time we found that in the recreations the most accomplished activities were to talk with friends (86.4%), play in the sports fields (47.5%) and dating (23.3%). Most of the young people do not participate in school sports (76.7%). The most accomplished activities after school were: watching TV (100%), cleaning the Institution (96.2%), listening to Music (89.3%), studying (87.4%), playing on the computer and on Facebook (82.6%) and doing physical activity (table tennis, football, among others) (73.8%). Regarding the accomplishment of these activities, the young people reported doing them daily or at least 2 to 3 times a week. When asked if they would like to occupy their free time within the institutions otherwise, the young people were divided, even though the majority responded that they did not (53.4%). As young people are in an open regime, we asked them which activities were most frequently carried out, outside the institution, and they answered that it was a walk with their friends (87.4%), and that the frequency of this activity was daily or at least 2 to 3 times a week. When asked if they would like to take their free time away from institutions in a different way, most of the young people said no, given that their activities are their preference.",

An EOT patient is exposed to a variety of painful procedures and, if the pain is not controlled, it can lead to multiple complications: physical (cardiovascular, neurological and pulmonary) and psychological (stress, anxiety and delirium), so nurses must have credible instruments for evaluation and monitoring.",

[4] report that although BPS is more sensitive in identifying the patient's response, CPOT is a good alternative. It was also verified that both instruments are sensitive to painful procedures, with an increase in several indicators [1, 2, 6]. There was also a significant statistically correlation between the values of arterial tension and the performance of a painful procedure, (the higher the pain value, the higher the arterial tension) [5,6].",

As a data collection technique, we used participant observation and semi-structured interviews.",
        " Results ",
        "We verified that the relation established between students differed according to whether it was a first or a second clinical teaching. The knowledge that the group acquired about themselves and about the methodologies adopted by the tutors, was different in the different contexts. In the first medical school (medicine), despite the little knowledge that the students had among themselves, the established relationship was very cooperative and cordial, based on the spirit of help. This was due to a number of factors, namely, a first clinical experience, leading to a high need to share information and knowledge related to the context and clinical practices; the lack of knowledge about tutors; and the lack of safety in the care of patients. The relationships established in this space were, therefore, strong and cohesive. In the clinical teaching of surgery, the relation established was different, highlighting more divergences/heterogeneities. According to the students' opinion, this fact was related to the work methodology/distribution of students and the request of academic work by the teachers.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "We verified that on the 2nd clinical teaching, the relationships established between students were influenced by interpersonal competition logics. As it is known, the need to form more restricted groups can lead to unleashing alliance dynamics and oppositions among students, giving rise to behaviours of competitiveness, or of helping others, or even to the development of individualized work. Another aspect that seems to have been strongly conditioning, were the methodological strategies adopted by the tutors of the different clinical contexts.",

Electronic databases were used, namely EBSCO and B-on, with the following descriptors: Caregiver; Family Caregivers; Needs; Dependent. The second stage corresponded to the adaptation of the Intervention Program, with the use of the Delphi technique on a group of experts. The last phase corresponded to a quasi-experimental study, with pre- and post-intervention evaluation, with the implementation of the program on 70 family caregivers, using home visits.",
        " Results ",
        "With the review of the literature were obtained 21 articles (ten quantitative studies, five qualitative studies, four systematic reviews of the literature, a review of the literature and a mixed study). The evidenced needs were organized by the Transition Theory: community and social resources; knowledge and preparation; personal meaning, beliefs and attitudes; and socioeconomic condition. The consensus technique allowed the structuring of a Nursing Intervention Program, with 93 interventions, divided in emotional and instrumental support. The implementation of the Intervention Program implied, on average, 6 home visits to the caregivers, emotional support provision and caregiver training.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "A Nursing Intervention Program, with structured and contextualized interventions in the home context, with family caregivers of dependent persons, is a facilitator for the transition experienced by caregivers, but also an important instrument of the work developed by nurses. Thus, it provides the necessary emotional support and skills that enable caregivers to optimize care delivery.",

        " Background ",
        "Critically ill patient\u2019s (CIP) nursing care quality has improved significantly in the last years because of important technological improvements. In pre-hospital, emergency and intensive care settings, they contribute to the valuation of technical competencies over relational aspects. The emergent need to stabilize the CIP diverts the attention away from the psychological and emotional support, increasing anxiety and diminishing the patient\u2019s cooperation, making the care experience increasingly hostile. Vulnerability arises in these settings [1] as a condition to be appreciated in a \u201charmonious conciliation between the technological expertise and the art of caring\u201d [2], because it improves expectations and experiences, and increases the positive outcomes of the resuscitation process, giving greater visibility to the nurses\u2019 work. To understand the experiences of patients who lived emergency situations, as well as nursing interventions that reduce vulnerability, will allow for better care of the CIP [3].",
        " Objective ",
        "Our goal is to review the available evidence regarding nursing interventions that reduce vulnerability at emergency and resuscitation settings.",

        " Results ",
        "Nine qualitative and quantitative studies satisfied the search criteria and were included. These studies are from different countries and cultures and their analysis identified both the emergency setting and nursing interventions as elements that influence the CIP\u2019s subjective experience of vulnerability. Vulnerability is a permanently present condition in the human being and the recognition of the mutual vulnerability by nurses is a way of preserving the value of caring.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The experience of CIP in emergency and resuscitation settings is influenced by organizational, environmental and caring factors. Being cared by competent professionals [5,6], using a therapeutic relationship and responding to the patient main needs are the most valued aspects that convey safety and a significant decrease in vulnerability. Communication and empathy [6], with explanation of clinical procedures, allows the development of trust and reduces vulnerability, facilitating patient collaboration in the care provided. Recognizing the vulnerability of CIP and its influence on collaboration, recovery and satisfaction in care, allows developing strategies and abolishing mechanized and merely technical behaviours. Vulnerability is a continually present condition in humans and the recognition of vulnerability of the professionals themselves [7] is a way to socially preserve the value of caring in an emergency context.",

Male workers and those with a TEC had a better PWW in the IR, and those who worked \u2264 40 hours per week had higher PWW in SW. These results may be useful for designing interventions to promote wellness at work.",

        "Living longer may lead to a long period of disability and frailty with increasing care demands. Informal caregivers, namely family members, play a very important role in the provision of care to very old individuals. Informal care represents crucial support but the available knowledge on this topic is still scarce in the Portuguese context.",
        " Objective ",
        "To provide an overview of caregiving characteristics in a sample of dyads of informal caregivers and oldest old people (80+) from Porto.",
        " Methods ",
        "A sample of 72 caregiving dyads was considered. Sociodemographic data, information on the caregiving experience (e.g. length of care, relationship with the person cared) and the disability level of care receiver (Activities of Daily Living \u2013 ADL\u2019s and IADL\u2019s, and comorbidities) were obtained.",
        " Results ",
        "Informal caregivers had a mean age of 63.9 years (SD=9.95), were mostly women (76.4%), with children (70.8%), married (63.9%) and retired (50.0%). Time spent on caregiving was on average 9.73 hrs/day (SD=7.61) and the length of care was around 7 years (SD=6.15). Most of the sample had formal social support to help in the care provision: 54.2% receives support from home care services and 34.7% from day centres. Care receivers mean age was 92.0 years (SD=5.28), were mostly women (73.6%) and widowed (65.3%). Half of the care receivers (n=36; 50.0%) were completely dependent in ADL\u2019s, 30.6% were moderately dependent, 16.7% severely dependent, and 2.8 % were independent. Most of the sample was severely dependent in IADL\u2019s (95.8%). The mean number of comorbidities was 6.94 (SD=1.95), and the mean of medicines intake was 6.17 (SD=3.41).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This is an ongoing project but current data already shows that the amount of time spent on caring activities by women who are themselves in advanced age is very high, and probably exhausting due to the high level of functional dependency of the care recipients. A clear picture of tasks and probable exhaustion of the group of people taking care of very old people is crucial in order to plan which and how to deliver formal care to these dyads. Such planning is important for preventing/alleviating burden situations and raising the quality of life of care recipients and their families.",

        " Objective ",
        "Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate in vitro antioxidant properties of aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of three different commercial brands of R. officinalis and G. biloba.",
        " Methods ",
        "R. officinalis and G. biloba leaves from three different commercial brands were extracted with two solvents (water and 80% ethanol), and antioxidant activity of the extracts were screened using the superoxide anion and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH\u2022) radical scavenging, and metal ion chelating capacity.",
        " Results ",
        "A comparison of both plant extracts in the DPPH assay and Fe2+ chelating activity indicated that R. officinalis showed lower IC50 values comparing to G. biloba, ranging from 44.1-61.8 \u03bcg/mL (aqueous extracts) and 20.8-23.3 \u03bcg/ml (hydroalcoholic extracts) in the DPPH assay, and 93.1-329.0 \u03bcg/mL (aqueous extracts) and 33.4-71.0 \u03bcg/mL (hydroalcoholic extracts) in the Fe2+ chelating activity. For the superoxide radical scavenging activity, the hydroalcoholic extracts of R. officinalis showed the best IC50 values, ranging from 5.1-15.5 \u03bcg/mL, with one brand showing and IC50 value lower (5.1 \u03bcg/mL) than positive control (5.8 \u03bcg/mL - ascorbic acid). Results also showed that in both plants and brands, the highest antioxidant activity was found mainly in the hydroalcoholic extracts, for all the assays tested.",

        "The purpose of this literature review (LR) was to identify nursing strategies for promoting patient safety.",
        " Methods ",
        "Using the methodology recommended by the Cochrane Centre, this LR was guided by the research question: \u201cWhat are the strategies that promote patient safety associated with nursing practice?\u201d A research was carried out in scientific databases, in EBSCOhost (CINAHL\u00ae MEDLINE\u00ae) and SciELO, with publication dates between January of 2012 and December of 2017, with descriptors \u201cpatient safety\u201d, \u201csafety culture\u201d and \u201cnursing care\u201d, having emerged 47 articles.

        " Results ",
        "The identification of risks for people during nursing care and the incorporation of good practices and trust in teamwork, contribute to the improvement and development of a safety culture in health care [1,2]. The guarantee of satisfaction of the professional, the communication between professionals and institution, and the support to the team given by the administrations, are strategic factors for the assurance of patient safety [3, 4]. Nurses' perceptions about the safety culture of the patient and the intention to report adverse events are significant in promoting patient safety [5-7]. Coaching behaviour showed a significant and positive correlation with safety culture and coaching behaviours of team leaders were associated with higher degrees of perceived safety culture and stronger intentions to report adverse events [2,8]. Openness of communication and non-punitive responses to mistakes, as well as teamwork influence the patient's safety culture [5, 7].",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Through this LR it was possible to perceive that the safety culture is an issue still underdeveloped in health organizations, where nurses have an essential role. Nursing practice is related to the professionals' perception of patient safety, which is related to a set of strategies that minimize the risks of adverse events.",

Cognitive interventions are related to the maintenance of cognitive function and are associated with independence and well-being [1, 2]. A cognitive intervention could be considered as a complex intervention once it contains several interacting components [3]. The MIND&GAIT project expects the development of a structured digital cognitive stimulation program to be used with older adults with mild to moderate cognitive decline.",
        " Objective ",
        "To develop and validate an elderly-friendly multi-domain digital cognitive stimulation program.",
        " Methods ",
        "To develop the program, the research team followed Guidelines for complex interventions from The Medical Research Council. The development process comprises four phases [3]. The first phase corresponds to a Preliminary Phase (I), the second to a Modelling Phase (II), the third to a Field Test Phase (III) and the last to a Consensus Conference Phase (IV).",
        " Results ",
        "The digital stimulation cognitive program has 8 individual sessions and 1 group session. The program has already passed for Phase I, which corresponds to an initial conceptualization of the program design and its support materials. At the moment, it is on Phase II, being presented to an experts\u2019 panel to gather different opinions and evaluations from specialists in the area of cognitive interventions. Each session of the program will later be evaluated at Phase III. All the contributions and analysis resulted from the previous phases will be synthesized in phase IV. It is expected that the critical evaluation, provided by specialists in the area of cognitive interventions, will result in a well-founded and structured intervention to be applied in older adults with mild to moderate cognitive decline. The program\u2019s construction, supported by guidelines and based in elderly-friendly digital components, intends to give a response to the challenge of an increasing aged population allying e-health. The program is to be used by health professionals and informal caregivers, in order to work as a possible way to prevent or minimize cognitive decline.",

We had to study the essential contents of the nursing process at home and implemented in the system, in order to create a data structure with the closest resemblance to S-Clinic. Then, to obtain this information a meeting was held with nursing experts to provide their knowledge in this area.",
        " Results ",

The first six months emerge as a transient, predictable and irreversible milestone. The transition to parenting is marked by the changes and repercussions that drive the child's growth and development, predating and precipitating others in the family life cycle.

        " Methods ",
        "Therefore, the total phenolic content (TPC) and the total flavonoid content (TFC) have been determined, as well as the antioxidant properties of extracts of the different forms of presentation/parts of the garlic existing in the market (bulb, in powder and in tablets/capsules), by the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH\u2022) method and by evaluation of the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The scavenging capacity of the same extracts against reactive species (O2-\u2022, H2O2, NO\u2022) was also evaluated. Finally, the biological activity of the presentation forms of garlic existing in the market was compared with the one of the garlic peel, considered food waste, taking also into account some variables that can influence the properties of the bulb, that is, boiling and freezing.",
        " Results ",
        "TPC was superior in the frozen chopped garlic sample, having the garlic tablets the lowest content. The cooked garlic presented an inferior value of TPC when comparing with the raw chopped bulb. These results indicate that cooking and freezing methods intervene directly with the total phenolic content, but in an opposite way. The extract of cooked garlic had the higher value of TFC, belonging the lowest tenor to garlic tablets. Radical DPPH\u2022 and FRAP methods allowed to verify that the cooked garlic extract evidenced a superior antioxidant activity. This result can be explained by cell wall rupture derived from heating, provoking antioxidant substance release, new and/or stronger antioxidant substance formation or oxidant enzymes inhibition [4]. The frozen chopped garlic extract presented the highest scavenging capacity of the three studied reactive species. In general, the higher the total phenolic content, the greater the capacity of inhibition of reactive species NO\u2022, O2-\u2022 and H2O2.",

        "Food conservation is a challenge for the food industry. The high respiration rate, the lack of physical protection to avoid water loss and the changes due to microbial attack are often associated with loss of food quality, contributing to deterioration through browning, weight loss and texture changes [1]. Furthermore, bacteria, moulds, enzymatic activity (mainly polyphenol oxidase) and biochemical changes can cause spoilage during storage [2]. The use of ionizing energy for preservation has been widely studied by the food industry. However, studies evaluating the effects of ionizing radiation are mostly available in cultivated species, being scarce the reports on wild species and food waste, considered add-value foods. In this regard, food technology is making progress towards increasing food preservation and contributing to a reduction of the incidence of food-related diseases. Previous studies assessing the potential of gamma irradiation as a suitable technique to increase natural products shelf-life were focused in nutritional and chemical parameters, including bioactive compounds and their antioxidant activity [3]. Many natural compounds found in edible food wastes (seeds) or grains (beans) present antioxidant activity. Among the most important natural antioxidants are phenolic compounds (flavonoids, phenolic acids and tannins), nitrogenous compounds (alkaloids, amino acids, peptides, amines and chlorophyll byproducts), carotenoids, tocopherols and ascorbic acid.",

The antioxidant activity was studied using DPPH\u2022 and FRAP assays. It was observed a slight increase in the content of bioactive compounds, as well as in antioxidant activity, with irradiation doses below 1.5 kGy. Final results showed that irradiation may be a viable technique to guarantee the content of bioactive compounds, as well as their biological properties, including antioxidant activity.",

        "The ability to perform movement imagery has been shown to influence motor performance and learning in sports and rehabilitation. Imagery is a cognitive process that can play an important role in planning and execution of movements or actions. Several instruments have been developed in order to evaluate the ability of Imagery in adults such has the MIQ-3, with Portuguese Athletes [1]. However, none focused on imagery ability questionnaire for children with the three modalities (kinesthetic, visual internal and visual external imagery) for Portuguese children\u2019s.",
        " Objective ",
        "The objective of this study was to translate and validate preliminary, for the Portuguese children\u2019s population, the Movement Imagery Questionnaire for Children [2], determining its initial psychometric qualities through an exploratory factor analysis model that supports it.",
        " Methods ",
        "In this study 162 subjects of both genders (124 male, 38 female) with a mean age of 10.1 years (SD = 16) participated. For the development of the Portuguese adaptation of the evaluation instrument, a methodology was developed in two phases: (1) the translation phase and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire and (2) the application of the Exploratory Factor Analysis method of the instrument. In the statistical analysis of data, we used the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett tests, to evaluate the quality of the correlations, and an exploratory factorial analysis (EFA) to determine the number of factors to be retained, the number of items associated with them and their internal consistency. The type of rotation adopted was the oblique rotation Promax.",
        " Results ",
        "Initially it was found that the procedures of translation and adaptation originated a Portuguese version of MIQ - C similar to the original version. Secondly, we found that the psychometric qualities proved their suitability of adaptation performed (KMO=0.822, Bartlett test p=.000), demonstrating that its factor structure is the same as the original version (12 items grouped into 3 factors, with 4 items each factor), with quite acceptable levels of validity and reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.85 to MIQ - C, 0.79 for the kinesthetic imagery, 0.74 for the visual internal imagery and 0.76 for the visual external imagery).",

        "Since 2000, the incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infections have increased, justifying the need for expedite, sensitive and specific methods of diagnosis. The existing rapid diagnostic tests vary widely in terms of clinical usefulness, which is evaluated on its sensitivity, specificity, turnaround time (TAT), cost, and availability. Besides that, there is no generally accepted gold standard or single optimal approach for C. difficile testing. This has challenged various stakeholders to develop point-of-care (POC) platforms with the best test performance characteristics, easy to use, and with rapid TAT, a critical element of POC testing to improve the clinical management of this infectious disease. POC testing can be done at home, at the primary care level, by hospital staff in emergency or operating rooms, intensive care units, as well as in extreme environments, such as remote or low-resource settings, or in conditions following emergency crises or natural disasters.",

        "The findings show that during the last decade extensive research efforts were underway to develop stand-alone platforms suitable for POC testing of C. difficile infections. Multistep algorithms using the polymerase chain reaction test for C. difficile toxin gene(s) have the best test performance characteristics, and a trend seems to exist in favour of molecular tests in detriment of immunoassays, in POC platforms. A common feature to all POC devices is the rapid TAT, within seconds-minutes to a few hours, which is crucial for C. difficile infection management. Some of these POC devices enable to run either multiplex tests on a single sample, or multiple samples. Although the majority of these stand-alone POC platforms for C. difficile testing are still prototypes, they may be looked at as a step towards more rapid, miniaturized, portable and easier to use test devices with the potential to affect healthcare decisions at its earliest stage.",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \u2013 V (DSMV) considers that the behavioural changes, i.e., the non-cognitive aspects of dementia, should be diagnosed, however, this is often not common practice. The identification and quantification of Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) can be objectively assessed using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI).

The first phase consisted of the translation and cultural and linguistic validation of the CMAI according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR). The following methodology was used a) Translation, b) Reconciliation, c) Retroversion, d) Harmonization, e) Cognitive testimony/analysis and e) Spelling review. In phase 2, the internal consistency was calculated using the Cronbach's alpha. The intra- and inter-rater reliability was determined using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), using the intra-rater (1,1) and the inter-rater (2,1) equations. A factorial exploratory analysis of the construct validity was conducted with 101 people with dementia (83.3 \u00b1 8.0 years; n=83; 82.2% female).

The management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) includes diet, physical activity and, often, medicines; it requires daily self-care and constant lifestyle-related choices [2]. It has been estimated that glycaemic control is achieved in less than 50% of T2D patients due to low self-care behaviour [2]. Sustained hyperglycaemia causes complications and premature death, as well as significant costs [1]. Improving self-care and T2D management is therefore crucial.",

        "Larval debridement therapy or \u201cmaggot\u201d therapy or biosurgery is described as the use of worms for the removal of non-viable tissue. Debridement is achieved thanks to the action of proteolytic enzymes, which are secreted by these larvae, liquefying the protein material on the surface of the wound, which is subsequently used by the larvae as a nutritive material. Healthy tissues are not affected, making this method the most selective among those available. In addition, this therapy helps to fight infection and helps normalization and closure of injuries. Larval debridement has been successfully used in a large range of chronic hard-to-heal wounds with presence of non-viable tissue of many aetiologies such as pressure ulcers, venous or ischemic wounds or diabetic foot ulcers [1-5]",

        "135 individuals were interviewed, with a mean age of 69.9 years and a standard deviation of 8 years, ranging from 60 to 97 years. The highest frequency was female (70.0%), white (81.3%), married (50.4%), and widowed (28.1%). About the occupation, 80.7% were retired and 54.6% received up to 250 Euros monthly. The schooling was predominantly until elementary school (74.6%), with 9.7% being illiterate, 4.5% with higher education and 0.7% with post-graduation. The majority (63.7%) did not practice physical exercise, 6.8% were smokers. The frequency of depression was 39.6%, with 5.2% categorized as severe depression. The use of drugs among the interviewees ranged from none (4.4%) to 25 different medications per day (0.7%), with 42.7% using 5 or more medications. Among those who reported the use of medication, 63% used antihypertensives, 32.6%, anti-depressants, 37.8%, anti-diabetics and 14.8% analgesics. Self-medication was identified in 23.9%. Polymedication had a significant association (p < 0.001) with the presence of arterial hypertension (RP = 2.85, CI 1.59-5.09), Diabetes Mellitus (RP = 2.31, CI 1.58-3.36), arthritis (RP = 1.60, CI 1.10-2.33), depression (RP = 1.87, CI 1.30-2.69), and cardiovascular diseases (RP = 2.29, CI 1.61 -3.26).",

        " Background ",
        "Nowadays, the increase of aging among world\u2019s population is becoming a reality, due to the decrease of the fertility and mortality rates and to the consequent increase of the average life expectancy [1]. This population aging brings different health, economic and social needs, turning elderly dependent and making them living in an institutionalized way [2]. In turn, the institutionalization favours the decline of their physical and cognitive functions, which consequently, weakens the old-aged. For all this, it is very likely that this age group will have D vitamin lack, being considered a serious public health problem at a worldwide level. Therefore, its supplementation must be considered, since this age group has the tendency of staying shortly exposed to solar radiation, has little mobility and their bodies manifest a reduction of the ability of synthesis of this hormone [3-5].",

This result has shown to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.003. On the other hand, other variables were compared, as for example, feeding, sun exposure, chronic diseases and intake of vitamin supplements, to try to understand if they had any influence on the 25(OH)D levels. Nevertheless, concerning these parameters, no great differences were verified, because p-values were always higher than 0.005.",

A negative correlation was obtained between professional experience and the error notification frequency, being this difference statistically significant (p < 0.05). Regarding the factors that contribute the most for error occurrence in OR, all of the participants mentioned the pressure for working fast, 87.0% referred the lack of human resources, 85.2% absence of motivation, 82.6% professional inexperience and workload overcharge and 65.2% of the participants considered fails in communication, as a factor preponderant to error.

Error notification is a central aspect of health care, particularly in the OR, hence it is fundamental to educate teams for the setting of strategies that promote a safety culture. It is important to continuously train professionals as well as work on the errors, making them a learning opportunity to prevent new errors associated to the same causes, to achieve a quality safety culture.",

The traditional method for detection and selection of a venous access includes the use of a tourniquet, palpation, and observation. However, when veins are not visible or palpable, this may lead to successive puncture attempts, causing pain to the patient and discomfort to the nurse, which results in increased costs [2]. In this regard, nurses should consider using vascular visualization technologies that aid in vein identification and selection for difficult intravenous access [3]. However, these technological resources available today, are still underutilized in Portugal.",

One of the studies emphasized that nurses from military hospitals have a superior knowledge and preparation in catastrophes, when compared with nurses from civil hospitals, given their military training [4]. The academic training, and the implementation of catastrophe training in the nursing curriculum is also addressed in three of the analysed articles [4\u20136]. The fact that hospital administrations and nursing leadership fail as promoters of training and promotion of regular exercises and simulations of disasters, is also evidenced in three articles [5,7,8].",

        "Fostering a culture of safety in health organizations should begin by evaluating the current culture. In Primary Health Care, patient safety becomes more important because a considerable proportion of safety incidents, detected in hospitals, originate from earlier levels of the system, from most of the interactions and from the largest volume of appointments of the functional units. At this level of health care, in family health units that provide accessible care, global and longitudinal follow-ups on the health process in a lifetime, enables greater health gains, and greater proximity to the patient. These are elementary health care units, based on multi-professional teams, composed by doctors, nurses and administrative staff. Still, many are on very different levels in terms of safety culture of the patient, although in all, the patient wants to have security.",

        " Results ",
        "By adjusting the responses within a maturity level for the patient safety culture of the 2 functional units, it was observed that the culture oscillated between 1.8 values in the USF model A, close to a reactive culture, in which the organization only cares about safety when problems occur, and 4 values for USF B, close to a proactive culture, with patient safety measures, even without adverse events, close to the ideal, with an informed and worried team.",

        "The functional units have the same typology, belong to the same Health Centre, but align the patient's safety culture with its greater and lesser complexity, respectively, model B and A. In other words, patient safety is not observed from the same perspective, although it operates in the same geographical area. There is a need for more and a better evaluation, information and training so that the safety culture develops.",

POLs are patients who share content as support for others [8]. Besides these agents, we see the rise of health professionals who connect directly with their audience [9]. These have conquered the media by promoting the \u201cright way to feed\u201d and legitimating themselves through a scientific discourse [10]. Considering the digital influencers context, a dichotomy arises: they can be taken as a threat to public health, or as partners fostering the communication between doctors and patients [9].

When the nurses think in ostomy of intestinal elimination, they think in the characteristics of the stoma. The smell has an important role in this category. Focused in person with intestinal ostomy, nurses are centred in self-care. The nurses consider support (emotional and familiar) and the teachings, the most important necessities of the person with an intestinal ostomy.

In 2010, 48.5 million couples worldwide were reported to have fertility problems [2], affecting both genders in 40% of the cases [3]. Due to this high and broad prevalence, infertility is acknowledged as a public health issue with prioritized intervention [4]. The prevalence in Portuguese population was first known in 2009, when a study estimated that about 260-290 thousand individuals were infertile and approximately 9% to 10% of couples displayed some type of reproductive confinement [5].

        "Currently, hospital pharmacies prepare formulations that aim to adjust the medication to the needs of each patient when the pharmaceutical industry is not able to respond to those needs [1]. One of the formulations produced in the hospital pharmacy is the diazepam suspension 0.4 mg/ml for paediatric use, obtained from diazepam tablets. However, the use of tablets or powders in oral liquid formulations may alter the stability of the active ingredients. Therefore, these formulations should be submitted to stability studies [2]. Nevertheless, the information on the stability of manipulated oral suspensions is scarce [3], so this study is relevant.",
        " Objective ",
        "The main goal of this study is to validate a method of diazepam quantification in suspensions. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the stability of diazepam in suspensions during 30 days, after the suspension preparation, establishing an expiration date.",
        " Methods ",
        "The quantification method of diazepam in oral suspensions arose from the adaptation of the method described in Portuguese Pharmacopoeia [4], for the same active ingredient in tablets. After the method\u2019s validation, the stability of diazepam was evaluated weekly, during 30 days, and the first analysis was done immediately after the preparation of the suspension. During the study period, suspensions were stored under suitable cold conditions (4\u00b0C).",
        " Results ",
        "With an accuracy, evaluated by the mean recovery of 80%, and a precision, evaluated by the variation coefficient, varying between 6.1 and 11.5%, the method proved to be practicable. Two suspension\u2019s samples were prepared with a similar diazepam concentration (0.43 mg/ml). The stability study of those suspensions showed that diazepam concentration decayed linearly, and that diazepam suspensions lose about 70% of their active principle within 30 days. Moreover, given the limits indicated by the Portuguese Pharmacopoeia [4] for diazepam tablets, it was verified that these suspensions only comply with these limits after 7 days, and that within the established period of validity these limits are no longer met.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Despite all limitations, the adapted method proved to be practicable and the results that followed have pointed to the possible instability of diazepam, when included in this oral suspension formulation. Given the dosage limits set for diazepam tablets [4] and knowing in advance that the validity period usually attributed to the suspension is 15 days, the results point to a new shelf-life of approximately 7 days. However, for a more consistent period of validity to be established, a more detailed stability study is required.",

        " Results ",
        "The intestinal microbiota is considered a \u201csuperorganism\u201d and is extremely complex. It is composed of a great diversity of microorganisms, which varies among individuals; however, it is essentially dominated by two phyla, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. It is dynamic and can be affected by several factors such as diet [2], breastfeeding [3], use of antibiotics [4,5] and type of delivery [6,7]. When an imbalance of the microbiota occurs, known as dysbiosis [1,8], the host is affected, being related to pathologies such as allergies, obesity and Crohn's disease. Some studies [9,10-14] have demonstrated that the microbiota participates in the maturation of the immune system and as such is predominant in the response to infectious processes. On the other hand, the intestinal microbiota seems to play a fundamental role in the prevention of allergies [15-26]. Inappropriate colonization after birth and excessive hygiene during childhood, may promote greater allergic reactions. Rats without bacteria have been shown to present more severe allergic reactions [22-26]. Regarding obesity, several authors [27-30] have demonstrated that changes in microbiota are strongly related to the establishment of obesity. It has been demonstrated that the type of microbiota influences obesity; rats with higher amounts of Firmicutes compared to the amount of Bacteroidetes, present greater capacity to promote fat deposition. On the other hand, a switch to a less caloric diet produced a change in the microbiota that led to a decrease in Firmicutes and an increase in Bacteroidetes. These results are surprising and suggest that future obesity control may originate from the type of intestinal microbiota.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Intestinal microbiota is of great relevance because it protects against external factors and the development of certain pathologies. It is therefore important to keep the population informed so that a microbiota considered \u201cnormal\u201d can be maintained from childhood to adulthood.",

        "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of aging on the neuromuscular reaction time and electromechanical delay during the performance of the karate frontal kick (Mae-Geri).",
        " Methods ",
        "Participated in this study 9 elite karate athletes (age, 21.0 \u00b1 2.47 years; height, 175 \u00b1 6.53 cm; weight, 72.0 \u00b1 9.25 kg) and 9 veteran karate practitioners (age, 54.0 \u00b1 3.87 years; height, 176 \u00b1 4.72 cm; weight, 76.0 \u00b1 9.17 kg). Surface electromyography was recorded from rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) portions of the quadriceps femoris, long head of the biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA) and lateralis gastrocnemius (GA). Kinematic analysis was performed with the Ariel Performance Analysis System (APAS, Ariel Dynamics-2003). The neuromuscular reaction time was defined as the time interval between the auditory stimulus and the onset of electrical activation of a muscle, while the electromechanical delay was the time interval between the onset of the electric activity of a muscle and the beginning of joint movement. Student t-test (two-tailed) was used to analyse the differences between groups, with a significance level of p < 0.05 (SPSS 17.0).",
        " Results ",
        "It was observed a tendency to a longer neuromuscular reaction time of the TA in veteran karate practitioners than among elite karate athletes (136.00 \u00b1 58.80 vs 122.00 \u00b1 45.94 ms, p = 0.566), although a significantly shorter neuromuscular reaction time was found in the RF in veteran karate practitioners (137.00 \u00b1 27.93 vs 184 \u00b1 51.55 ms, p = 0.030). Veteran karate practitioners presented a significantly longer RF electromechanical delay than elite karate athletes (127.00 \u00b1 59.11 vs 39.00 \u00b1 47.68 ms, p = 0.003).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The results of the study showed that with the aging process there is an increase in the electromechanical delay, although no negative impact on the neuromuscular reaction time has been observed. Therefore, continuous sport practice in veteran karate practitioners seems to attenuate the effects of aging on neuromuscular systems.",

        " Results ",
        "Seventy-eight individuals, mainly female (59.0%), with a mean age of 81.7 years (SD= 10.2) were evaluated. Mean length of stay was 6.4 years (SD= 7.8). MNA-SF classified 32 individuals (41.0%) at risk of malnutrition and 20 (25.6%) as malnourished. According to the elderly Body Mass Index (BMI) classification, 28 were at risk of malnutrition and 23 were malnourished (35.9% and 29.7%, respectively), showing a positive correlation with MNA-SF results (p < 0.05). The female gender presented an overall higher risk of malnutrition (p < 0.05). Those who were more dependent to feed themselves were at risk of malnutrition or malnourished (p < 0.05). Fifty-seven of the subjects (73.0%) were under polymedication, with a mean number of daily medications of 7.5 (SD= 3.4). A higher number of regular medications is correlated with higher BMI (p < 0.05). No association was found between length of stay or number of drugs taken and malnutrition.",

        "In this population, a high prevalence of risk of malnutrition was identified, particularly in the female gender. Although previously described, a correlation between polypharmacy and malnutrition was not found. A closer look to type of medication might be necessary. In this sample, a very long length of stay was also found. Nutritional intervention in this population should be prompt since admission and regularly provided, preventing the development of malnutrition and comorbidities.",

        "With this work it was concluded that there are deficiencies regarding the structural and operating conditions of canteens/refectories, which could be filled by the construction/enlargement of spaces. Regarding the evaluation of the quality of the oils and temperature of the meals, there were flaws, with possible repercussions on the quality of the meals served. It is also important to develop skills for the elaboration of menus suited to the different age groups and the confection of healthier diets. Emphasis can be placed on the training of manipulators in order to raise awareness of the repercussions of their role and responsibilities in preventing contamination.

Despite the procedure\u2019s importance for healthcare quality, it has some risks and complications such infiltration, bloodstream infection and phlebitis. Healthcare associated infections are considered a worldwide problem, having a considerable impact on the patients\u2019 and community\u2019s health and economy [1,2]. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, prevalence of this type of infections is 6.0% and 10.6%, in Europe and in Portugal, respectively. Bloodstream infections, related with venous catheters, have one of the lowest prevalence, but they may lead to serious consequences [2].",

        " Results ",
        "Catheterization is considered a risk factor because it creates a possibility for microorganisms to access to the bloodstream. The implementation of an insertion protocol is not enough to eliminate microorganisms and avoid the formation of a biofilm. Integrated in maintenance procedures, flushing contributes to reduce the risk of complications. Studies concluded that the use of an adequate technique of flushing may reduce the biofilm and the probability of infection [3]. Infusion Nurses Society [4] and the Royal College of Nursing [5] include it as a procedure to prevent complications of the infusion therapy. Despite the recommendations, the implementation of this practice is not consistent. To explain lack of adherence, one of the reasons pointed out is the complexity of the task [6]. These results support the development of a Medical Device (MD) (double chamber syringe) that may contribute to the adherence of the flushing practice.",

        "Hepatic transplantation is a lifesaving therapy that has been increasing over the years in Portugal. Its success is due largely in part to the use of immunosuppressants, like tacrolimus, the first-line immunosuppressant drug for people undergoing liver transplantation. It is a drug with narrow therapeutic window and great inter-individual variability. This variability is explained in part by polymorphisms of the CYP3A5 gene, which encodes the CYP3A5 metabolizing enzyme. The rs776746 polymorphism affects the CYP3A5 gene and gives rise to a non-functional metabolizing enzyme. The CYP3A5 gene is expressed in both the liver and the gut, that is, the metabolism of tacrolimus is affected by the transplanted liver (donor) genotype, as well as by the gut (receptor) genotype. The identification of polymorphisms becomes important especially in the period immediately after transplantation in order to avoid acute rejection of the organ.",

        " Results ",
        "We selected 23 articles that discuss the influence of the rs776746 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus. The evidence suggests that individuals with the CYP3A5*3 (non-expressing) allele have a decreased metabolism of tacrolimus and, consequently, lower blood concentrations of the drug compared to individuals carrying the CYP3A5*1 (expressing) allele. The receptor genotype plays a more important role in the first days after transplantation and the donor genotype becomes more important later when the transplanted organ begins to function properly.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This review concluded that regarding hepatic transplantation it is important to identify both the polymorphisms affecting the metabolism of tacrolimus in the donor and recipient genotypes for a more effective dose adjustment, especially in the critical period immediately after transplantation.",

In this context, the FITWORK project aims to develop good practices to support ergonomics and health by implementing physical activity programs, addressed to reduce specific ergonomic risks at the workplace. This 2-year project (2017-2018) is co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union and coordinated by Instituto de Biomec\u00e1nica of Valencia (IBV) Spain. The partners are the University of Coimbra (UC); Romtens Foundation, Romania; Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e); the European Network for Workplace Health Promotion (ENWHP) and KOMAG, Poland (http://fitwork.eu/).",

        "Peak expiratory flow (PEF) has been traditionally used to monitor lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) before pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) sessions. However, PEF mainly reflects changes in large airways and it is known that COPD primarily targets small airways. Adventitious respiratory sounds (ARS - crackles and/or wheezes), are related to changes within lung morphology and are significantly more frequent in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Thus, ARS may be also useful for the routine monitoring of lung function during PR programs.",
        " Objective ",
        "This study explored the convergent validity of ARS and PEF in patients with COPD.",
        "Methods",
        "Twenty-four (24) stable patients (66 \u00b1 9 years; FEV1 71 \u00b1 19% pred) participating in a PR program were included. Assessments were conducted immediately before one PR session. Presence of ARS (crackles and/or wheezes) at posterior right chest was first assessed by a physiotherapist using a digital stethoscope (ds32a, ThinkLabs, CO, USA). Resting dyspnoea was collected using the modified Borg scale (0-10) and PEF with a peak flow meter (Micro I, Carefusion, UK). Independent t-tests, Pearson and point-biserial correlations were used.",

PEF was negatively correlated with presence of ARS (r = -0.41; p = 0.048). Resting dyspnoea was negatively correlated with PEF (r = -0.41; p = 0.039), but not with ARS (r = 0.21; p = 0.32).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Findings suggest that both ARS and PEF offer complementary information before a PR session, but that ARS provide additional information on the patents\u2019 respiratory status.

        " Methods ",
        "Ecological study of the information on the hospitalizations of people over 60 years of age was obtained by hospital admission authorizations (HAA) from the Hospital Information System (HIS), from all municipalities in the state of Santa Catarina (SC) from 2008 to 2015. For the definition of the Primary Care Sensitive Conditions (PCSC), the official report published by the Ministry of Health was used [4]. The crude PCSC rate was calculated by the ratio between the number of PCSC in the elderly and the reference population for the period multiplied by 10,000. Next, the PCSC hospitalization rates for the elderly were standardized by age using the direct method, using the world population [5] as the standard. To soften the historical series, as a function of the oscillation of the points, was calculated the moving average centred in three groups. The analysis was performed through the Joinpoint program, version 4.3.1, used to calculate the variation of the rates of hospitalization of elderly people by age-adjusted PCSC, in the period from 2008 to 2015, resulting in the behaviour of the rate in the period studied for each municipality of Santa Catarina.",
        " Results ",
        "The analysis showed that for each percentage point of increase in the elderly population rate, one percentage point increases in the annual rate of hospitalization rate for PCSC in the elderly (R2 = 0.025). The variables of the performance of attention to the elderly did not show association in the hospitalizations.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The individual's lifestyle may be more determinant for a healthy aging than access to services when the individual has aged.

For this, 52 caregivers who are relatives of people with Alzheimer's disease were identified through a convenience sample from both private homes and day-care centres in the North region of Portugal. A questionnaire was administered that contained the sociodemographic characterisation of the caregivers as well as questions that dealt with different facets of the disease, ranging from pathophysiology to intervention strategies. The questionnaire was designed for this study, underpinned by consistent theoretical bases, and was sent to five experts for evaluation.

The questions are essentially closed, with the only open question coming at the end, relating to the difficulties experienced by the family members in caring for the patient.",
        " Results ",
        "Focusing on aspects related to literacy, the main results indicate that although 87% of these caregivers know how to define Alzheimer's disease, only about 30% understand what underlies it, while about 50% show some difficulties in identifying risk factors. Most of them (75%) are able to list symptoms of the disease but only half know how to keep the sick person active. It should be noted that only 38% can identify ways to preserve memory and that about 30% of family caregivers are unaware of the purpose of the medication.",

In this context, unfinished, delayed, or missed nursing care (MNC), which is a strong indicator of health care quality, can compromise quality care and patient safety.",

        " Methods ",
        "A systematic literature review was conducted on studies available in the EBSCOhost and B-on databases. Twenty-four articles were selected based on predefined criteria. All articles were published between 2012 and 2017.",
        " Results ",
        "The studies showed that nurses and patients have different perceptions about MNC. Autonomous interventions related to early mobility and walking, repositioning every 2 hours, or oral and body hygiene are more often missed than interdependent interventions. [1-5]. Medication administration within 30 minutes of prescription, planning and update of care plans, vital signs monitoring, and treatment effectiveness assessment also emerged as MNC [5-7]. Predictive factors are associated with the patient (health status/workload) [2, 5]; the nurse (interruptions by other professionals or patients\u2019 relatives) [4, 8]; the materials or equipment (late deliveries) [9], or the hospital\u2019s health care policies (management/leadership and staffing) [10]. The nurse-patient/family communication emerged as MNC, whereas the nurse-other health professional communication emerged as a predictive factor because teamwork and its effectiveness are compromised [2, 11]. Nurses\u2019 personal interests and moral sense can influence the occurrence of MNC. Therefore, the strategies used to reduce the incidence of MNC should be adjusted to the needs of each setting [2, 5].",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Although MNCs are being explored internationally, it is an understudied topic in Portugal, which may be explained by the punitive error reporting culture. The findings cannot be generalized due to the diversity of studies. Thus, the phenomenon of MNC and its impact on patient/family prognosis should be explored in different settings, with the purpose of achieving excellence in health care and ensuring that people recognize the importance of health care.",

However, it is not possible, to conclude that these vestibular changes are directly related to the placement of the CI.

Since the Declaration of Bolonha, nursing students are provided with a more practical and profession oriented nursing training [1, 2]. As our professionals\u2019 skills become more recognized in the global health market, also our need to improve education and professional development rises. The best way to enhance the quality of practice education provided to undergraduate nursing students and to improve clinical outcomes is by enriching the academic curriculum with evidence-based nursing practices (EBNP) [3]. The Best Practice Guidelines Program (BPGP) was developed by the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) to support EBNP [4].",

We considered two main areas to intervene, in order to address the challenge of generating scientific evidence for nursing practice: the academic and the clinical setting (partner institutions, where students undertake their clinical practice). The implementation process included three fundamental players from both settings: professors, nursing students and clinical nursing instructors. To evaluate our performance and measure the improvements, we created structure, process and outcome indicators for each guideline.

This is not to say that we should neglect the treatment of disease, but rather that we must make a clear bet on its prevention according to our daily behaviour and the circumstances in which we live. The practice of swimming is recommended, especially for children, since it presents benefits, namely in the treatment of respiratory diseases, allergic problems and in the improvement of motor coordination and/or postural problems. However, during swimming lessons, children are exposed to numerous harmful risk factors to the middle ear and the outer ear.

It is also known that not all learning problems are due to auditory processing disorders and all cases of auditory processing disorders do not lead to learning problems. Studies also point out that an adequate and personalized auditory training may be a viable option in the rehabilitation of auditory information processing in the central nervous system (brain neuroplasticity training), being the early assessment and intervention important to minimize the associated consequences, such as the possible difficulties on the learning process.",

        "Countries in Europe and North America managed to control and eradicate most of the infectious-parasitic diseases that occurred in the first half of the twentieth century [1]. Nevertheless, infectious and parasitic diseases are still present in certain metropolitan areas of Brazil, despite the increased prevalence of chronic diseases. This work aims to present the general aspects of the situation of diseases related to inadequate environmental sanitation (IESDs) and of the sanitation policy of Porto Alegre.",
        " Objective ",
        "The general objective was to examine the public policy for environmental sanitation in Porto Alegre, and, the specific objectives were: I) to analyse the relationship between indicators of poverty and inadequate environmental sanitation and the occurrence of diseases related to inadequate environmental sanitation; and, II) to present the situation of IESDs and the sanitation policy of Porto Alegre.",
        " Methods ",
        "The method was qualitative and quantitative, with data collection and analysis of public policies. The period analysed was from 2008 to 2012. Data were obtained from Health Information Systems, DATASUS website of the Ministry of Health, along with a set of basic indicators from the Porto Alegre\u2019s Observatory. The indicators were classified according to the specific objectives: poverty(P); environmental sanitation(S); diseases(D). Pearson's linear correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis to test the associations between poverty and basic sanitation indicators with IESDs indicators.",
        " Results ",
        "The results showed that the biggest problems related to IESDs occur in the poorest regions, which are: Restinga, Parthenon, Nordeste, Lomba do Pinheiro, Gloria, Ilhas and Extremo Sul. The higher concentration of Dengue was found in the Parthenon region; Leptospirosis in the regions of Restinga, Extremo Sul, Lomba do Pinheiro, Norte and Eixo Baltazar; Hepatitis A in the regions of Ilhas, Nordeste, Humait\u00e1 /Navegantes, Centro, Lomba do Pinheiro, Norte, Leste and Parthenon. Regarding the public policy for Environmental Sanitation in Porto Alegre, we concluded that there are some urban policies, but the subject needs greater systemic view directed to the most specific problems of the city. About the Sanitation Plans, we concluded that the regions that need the sanitation, at most - a sewage collection network - have a lower footage for infrastructure installation, such as, the region of Ilhas. The sanitation basic plan (Water) gives various information about areas that need the implementation of infrastructures of universal supply, however there is still no date of when that will be possible.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Finally, infectious and parasitic diseases are a reality in Porto Alegre. Still at the XXI century, there are about 1,200 annual hospitalizations in health services (SUS) and are responsible for about 750 deaths per year in the capital city.",

        "Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of worldwide mortality, and hypertension is an important public health problem [1]. Nonadherence to treatment influences the health of the patient and can generate several complications. In this way, health care providers are confronted with the best strategies to promote effective management of the disease, together with patients and families. The nursing consultation seems to be a privileged setting for assisting patients for healthy behaviour changes with a personalized intervention adjusted to the needs of each one [2, 3].",

        " Results ",
        "In this research 372 articles were found, and 10 were selected, corresponding to 2,565 hypertensive patients over 18 years old, of whom 64% were female. Despite the differences found in the methodologies of these studies, the results indicated a poor adherence to the treatment [7]. The analysis resulted in two major categories that explain patients' adherence to the treatment of hypertension, namely the factors that influence adherence and nursing interventions. The most significant factors that inhibit adherence are complex drug regimens, lack of knowledge, and poor physical activity. The nursing interventions that enhance adherence were the adoption of continued educational strategies.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Patient adherence is a complex issue with a huge burden for the health system because it not only implies the change of patient behaviours, but also other factors like the involvement of caregivers and families. Considering the factors described in this review, the nursing consultation, through the definition of educational strategies, seems to increase patient adherence to treatment. In future research, guidelines will be suggested that aim to increase adherence to treatment.",

        "In Portugal the low literacy in health is recognized. Literacy in health is not only related to education, it arises from a convergence of factors involving education, cultural and social factors and health services. According to data provided by the World Health Organization and World Bank, if awareness is not raised and if global behavior does not change, road traffic injuries will increase dramatically by 2020, becoming the third leading cause of death around the world [1]. Nurses assume that they can be real agents of change and have a role to play in helping to shape the behavior of parents/other educators and to train them in the correct use of child safety seats (CSS).",
        " Objective ",
        "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the partnership between nurses from the Cova da Beira Hospital Center and the regional security forces generated better results in the effective use of CSS of parents or other carers during car transport and whether there is a gap between them and parents who have never been targeted by the team of nurses and security forces.",

The interview and the observation occur at the same moment with the driver of the vehicle that carries the child and is the subject of stop operation.",
        " Results ",
        "The stop operations had a strong pedagogical and informative component, where the drivers were clarified about the data found during the observation, thus offering a good training opportunity in an informal context. In this study, 83% of the sample was for the first time benefiting from a stop operation promoted by the PROVIDAS and it was possible to conclude that drivers who have already been subject to the supervision of PROVIDAS make fewer errors in the use of CSS in relation to drivers who had never been audited by this team.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The results suggest to the positive influence of the training and pedagogical activity of nurses and the importance of the partnership with security forces in the effective use of CSS.

As a chronic disease, it poses as a threat to physical and social existence, amputating or redefining the roles we assume as socially integrated individuals, leading to a heavy deconstruction on the everyday world.",
        " Objectives ",
        "a) Describe the representations of the person with dementia on the disease, after the diagnosis; b) understand the process of adjustment of the person with dementia, from the lived experience.",
        " Methods ",
        "The methodological option was an empirical research study of the qualitative type, of phenomenological-interpretative nature and inspired by the hermeneutic philosophy of Paul Ricoeur. Seven people with mild dementia were interviewed, most diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, with a mean of 71 years old. For each participant, two interviews were conducted in a natural setting [residence], with data collection occurring between July and October 2017.",
        " Results ",
        "The main focus of the present analysis focused on the identity of the person with dementia. Two main themes were created, taking into account the factors that may influence their (de)construction. The first theme \u201clife in suspense\u201d aims to describe knowledge and representations about dementia. Regarding the analysis of the lived experience, it was represented by the second theme \u201cmap the transition process - living on the edge of the cliff\u201d.",
        "Findings from this study indicate that disease representations are useful frameworks for developing an understanding of how people with dementia try to manage the threats posed by disease as they negotiate the day-to-day process. The development of disease representations reflects an understanding that the progressive decline imposed by dementia is linked to a set of consequences that are circumscribed in the personal, relational, and transcendental dimensions.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "In summary, the person with dementia faces several challenges, the first one stems from the need to manage the treatment; the second arises from the need to create and assign meaning to their social roles and finally the need to deal with the emotional consequences that arise from the process of disease by providing the person with adaptive strategies that promote their adjustment. In fact, this study, in addition to revealing the lived experience of the person with dementia, has the potential to contribute to the improvement of nursing care in mental health.",

Inadequate oral care develops an important role in this setting allowing various organisms to flourish in oral cavity and cause infections [1]. Many VAP prevention guidelines include oral care, but they don\u2019t specify its demandings.",

We found 256 documents and after analysing their abstract and methodological quality, nine documents were selected. Data were compiled in a chart in terms of grade of evidence, acceptance and applicability.",
        " Results ",
        "We found inconsistent results regarding the use of an antiseptic solution in oral care, though there were meta-analysis which indicated the benefit of chlorhexidine mostly in cardio-thoracic surgical patients [2-4]. We also found evidence that tooth brushing reduces oral bacterial colonization and may reduce VAP when used with chlorhexidine [5,6]. There is no consensus regarding the adequate concentration of chlorhexidine. Some studies, thought, find an association with the use of chlorhexidine 2% and the incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [7]. Because of this potential risk, we do not recommend the use of this type of concentration, as more randomized controlled trials are needed. We found evidence in VAP prevention oral care comprising suctioning, tooth and gums wash and rising with 15 mL chlorhexidine 0.12%. This procedure should be performed at least 2 times a day. Secretions removal and moisturization should occur between 2 to 4 times a day [1-9].",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This review allowed us to describe the adequate oral care in ICUs in order to potentially reduce VAP. As limitation of this study, we can find the lack of high grade of evidence concerning most recommendations. More randomized controlled trials are needed to support the impact of each intervention separately.",

        " Background ",
        "Nursing research has led to knowledge which has contributed to improving health care and to reduce costs. The implantation of guidelines ensures the transfer of the best evidence for clinical practice [1]. Substance-related problems can occur at any age, but usually begin in adolescence [2]. The Guideline Engaging Clients Who Use Substances developed by the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO), provides evidence-based recommendations related to the assessment and interventions for people over 11 years of age, who use substances, may be at risk of, or have a substance use disorder [3].",
        " Objective ",
        "To present the experience of the guideline implementation process of the RNAO\u2019s Engaging Clients Who Use Substances, in the curriculum of the nursing degree (CLE) of the Atlantic Health School (ESSATLA).",
        " Methods ",
        "Implementation procedures indorsed by the RNAO were followed, involving teachers, students and nurses from several clinical practice contexts. First, an analysis and reflection were made considering ESSATLA's CLE curriculum, Unit Sheets and the Engaging Clients Who Use Substances guideline recommendations. Afterwards, a guideline implementation plan was designed to fit the CLE, based on structure, process and outcome indicators. Teachers and clinical tutor train was performed and some guideline topics were included in several units: establishing therapeutic relationships [4] and person- and family-centred care [5].",
        " Results ",
        "To date, guideline implementation process results include several outcomes: seminar meetings held with all stakeholders involved in the guideline\u2019s implementation process; a partnership training project - Partnership training seminars; a workshop scheduling plan; Portuguese translation of the \u201cEngaging Clients Who Use Substances\u201d in process (teacher and nursing expert stakeholder collaboration); didactic materials to support content implementation in the nursing curriculum; student evaluation tools and instruments; three students included the topic of substance use in their end-of-course monograph project; some students in the clinical practice of the elderly did a in-service training session on this subject.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The implementation of this guideline in the CLE curriculum has empowered students to become more confident and competent to care for substance abusers, namely regarding screening, the assessment process and intervention in substance use disorders.

        "Over last decade, sales of vitamins have had a significant increase worldwide. Besides the growing of self-diagnosis and self-medication by consumers, these products are also often consumed without any control or medical supervision, during extended periods of time, due to the general misperception that natural indicates harmless. Despite its beneficial effects, excess intake of vitamin is not innocuous. Although vitamin B6 is a co-factor for several enzymatic reactions, involved in numerous metabolic and physiological processes, overdoses may produce neurological disturbances, including sensory neuropathy.",

        "The aims of this study were I) the description of PA (light, moderate and vigorous levels) and sedentary behaviours (SB) of ES boys and girls in relation with the time spent in each level of PA; II) to determine the average time children spend on each level of PA during 4 weekdays (9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday to Thursday) and, III) to compare the MVPA developed by children during formal physical education sessions, with other weekdays.",
        " Methods ",
        "Forty (40) voluntarily children with 7.9 \u00b1 0.6 years (30 girls and 10 boys) were authorized by their parents to participate in the study. PA was assessed using a three-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph\u00ae wGT3X-BT) during to 7.5 daily hours of school period. For classifying moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) a cut-off point of 818 counts per 5s was used.",
        " Results ",
        "The average duration of MVPA was 36.51 \u00b1 13.50 min per day. Only 35% of the participating children reached the recommended school-based MVPA of 30 min or more, per day. Children spent on average 71.74 \u00b1 6.37% of their school time on SB. MVPA of girls were lower (31.9 \u00b1 8.9 min/day) than boys (51.3 \u00b1 16.1 min/day, ES = 1.76, p=0.004). Our results showed that the percentage of MVPA on the day of the physical education lesson (11.4 \u00b1 3.8%) was higher, when compared to other weekdays (7.5 \u00b1 2.6%).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "We objectively assessed PA during school hours among elementary school-children. This study found that children spend the majority of their school time in SB and many of them do not perform sufficient time of being physically active at school. The low participation of girls in MVPA and the lesser time spend in MVPA on weekdays without physical education lessons are relevant data to reflect and implement strategies to increase the time of physical activity during school-time, which corresponds to one third of the daily life of children.",

        "Nowadays there is an overvaluation about the pain of giving birth. Therefore, Brazil presented 56% of caesareans and Portugal 33.1% in 2016. In order to assist women when giving birth, analgesia has been a strong ally to enable delivery without pain. There are non-pharmacological techniques for pain control in obstetrics. There is, the Sterile Water Injection on the Michaelis Triangle which causes immediate pain relief in the lumbosacral region. Physiologically, sterile water doesn\u2019t act as a local anaesthetic and doesn\u2019t inhibit the fibres that report visceral pain; however, causes a release of the C fibres and A-delta fibres associated with somatic pain. Distilled water stimulates A-delta fibres and subjugates the visceral pain reported by the C fibres, which fails to notify visceral pain, modulating afferent patterns of pain. In this way, it silences the C fibres and releases endorphins. Based on this mechanism, an experimental study has been done applying the finger ischemic compression technique to the same region, in Brazil in 2014, to characterize the technique as a tool to pain control.",
        " Objective ",

        " Methods ",
        "A Comparative study between those techniques through a systematic review of literature based on the Clinical Practice Guide on Normal Childbirth Care, by the Basque Government, about sterile water injection and the finger ischemic compression technique (Nursing Residency Program in Obstetrics, in Brazil in 2015). This study compares the effect versus time duration of analgesia between them.",
        " Results ",
        "The analysis of 292 studies showed that the sterile water injection into the Michaelis triangle decreased lumbar pain during delivery by approximately 60%, and the effect remained for up to 2 hours. In the finger ischemic compression experiment, there was a pain level reduction by 66%, remaining for 4 hours. However, in both cases, patients referred an intense burning during application.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This study contributes to pain control in obstetrics, as the two methods lead to a significant reduction of the pain level. However, finger ischemic compression had a longer duration of analgesia, when compared to sterile water injection. The injection in obstetrics is already recommended as an effective method for pain control and there is a need for further research on the finger ischemic compression experiment, to also consolidate the technique as a method of pain management.",

        "Several bioactive ingredients such as phytosterols, resveratrol, curcumin and catechin have shown efficacy in the prevention of chronic diseases, namely in cardiovascular diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the world. Besides all the potentialities, many of these bioactive ingredients present the disadvantage of instability and sensitivity to environmental factors (e.g. light and oxygen) and are also characterized by low water solubility due to its lipophilicity. Microencapsulation of bioactive compounds emerges as a strategy to improve their stability, avoiding adverse conditions and promoting their bioavailability. It includes a set of several techniques that allows the coating of these ingredients through a protective film, to guarantee its protection and to modulate its release at the target cells. Many techniques of microencapsulation and different materials can be used, the choice depends on the intended application, particle size, the release mechanism and on the physicochemical properties of both active material to be encapsulated and encapsulating agent.",

        "The search retrieved 10 studies. The findings demonstrated not only the potential of the compounds in the reduction of cardiovascular risk, through the action on risk factors, but also the increase of their activity due to the increase of their bioavailability, achieved through microencapsulation. The research also revealed a wide range of materials that can be used, while the choice of method must take into account several factors such as its cost and necessary equipment, as well as the quality of the microcapsules formed. The microencapsulation process has a wide range of advantages, namely the ability to increase gastrointestinal absorption of the bioactive compounds encapsulated, and in addition, while the conversion of those compounds into the powder form is enhanced, their stability increases and their handling is facilitated.",

Not all the specifications have the same importance in concept selection, and so this was analysed trough a weighted decision matrix. Based on the identified specifications, it was defined the corresponding criteria, which must be evaluated and weighted regarding their relative importance to each of the other criteria. These weights were summed for each criterion. As experts from different areas were involved, it was decided that each expert group should weigh, considering their experience. As expected, different matrixes were obtained and results were managed to achieve only one weight matrix which included the opinion of all the groups. A final weighted matrix with all the criteria and its weight for concept selection was obtained. Each concept of the syringe was evaluated according to these defined criteria and calculated it weighted sum. It was selected the concept with the highest weighted sum of all the defined criteria.",

        "By analysing the proposed weighting table of the specifications, and considering the defined relative weight, it was verified that the most relevant specifications are the cost, the number of operations to be performed and the possibility of error.

        "Pregnancy is a demanding period in terms of psychological reorganization in the transition to fatherhood [1,2]. The involvement of men in this period is associated with their own psychological well-being as well as the whole household [3]. This is a transition with implications for the couple, for the father/child relationship, and child development [4]. Contemporary fatherhood emphasizes the involvement of men and greater affective contact with their children, in addition to their traditional role as a financial provider [5].",

Men accept and try to actively engage in the pregnancy process and experience a panoply of positive and negative feelings and emotions, sometimes ambivalent. The prenatal period triggers the development of paternal identity. During this process, expectant fathers revaluate their personal values, reflect on their own fathering experiences and reshape their view of the world and themselves. Despite their proactive role in the fatherhood journey, they find obstacles and not bridges to their transition. The fact that they feel peripheral in prenatal care services makes it more difficult to embrace fatherhood and may compromise overcoming the transition process.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This study provided insight on the complex nature of this developmental transition and showed fragile environments in the approach of the expectant fathers to the prenatal care services. This reality encourages healthcare professionals to think critically about how fatherhood transition can be facilitated by practices which promote smoother transitions and benefit the family as a whole.",

The current therapy for DLBCL is the combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP). R-CHOP-14 and R-CHOP-21 are two subtypes of R-CHOP, which differ in their treatment, like CHOP-14 that has better results within high dosage in advanced stages, while CHOP-21 has better efficiency and better overall survival in elderly patients. These treatments have increased the survival of patients, though about 40% of patients there is still a failure rate of treatment. New approaches for relapsed DLBCL are outlined here, for example the understanding of the new drugs role, individualized treatments and dosage regimes.",

Caregivers were interviewed about sociodemographics, type of care (wholly compensatory, partially compensatory, supervision), time spent in self-care daily activities and its intensity (0-7) and with the Portuguese version of the Zarit Burden Interview [4]. Ethical procedures, according to Helsinki Declaration, were taken into account.",
        " Results ",
        "Caregivers were mainly females (n=80), with a median age of 51 years, married (n=84), with 12 years of education (n=33) and patients-mothers (n=20). These patients had majorly depressive disorders (36.3%). Caregivers cared for their relatives from 0 up to 54 years (Median=3.25; Mean=7.86; SD=10.78). Most of them (42.5%) corresponded to someone who provided care occasionally. Nevertheless, they provided a wholly compensatory care in most areas of patient self-care daily activities (Mean=26.58; SD=31.20). Preparing and providing meals (Mean=3.54; SD=3.29), Organizing medication (Mean=3.57; SD=3.16) and its administration (Mean=3.30; SD=3.29) was the most frequent self-care provided. Intensity of wholly compensatory care provided was higher in female (t=-2.950; p=0.004) older (r=0.215; p=0.022) relatives, who took full responsibility for caring (p<0.001), living with the patient (t=-2.762; p=0.007). Most caregivers revealed no burden (62.8%; Mean=38.31; SD=22.54). Burden was higher in females (t=-2.869; p=0.005), older (r=0.259; p=0.006) and among primary or secondary caregivers (p<0.001). Impact of giving care, interpersonal relations and perceptions of self-efficacy were also higher in older females with lower education relatives, primary caregivers and caregivers that perspective gravity of their relative illness higher.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The caregivers inquired were mainly secondary and provided total care in all areas. The burden presented by those was low, and they provided care especially in preparing meals and organizing and administering medicines. In this sample, care provided and burden were higher in older female caregivers, low educated and with a high perspective of gravity of their relative illness. Intervention among these caregivers is needed, promoting knowledge, improving skills and providing support, which can allow to reduce the psychological consequences of the needed assistance by the relatives.",

        " Methods ",
        "This is an experimental study, with a sample of 20 elderly people aged 67-91 years (mean of 80.70 \u00b1 5.99), who attended day centres and were enrolled in the \u201cAtividade S\u00e9nior\u201d Program. This Program was developed by the social responsibility of the Viseu city council and is very important among the community, to promote physical activity in the population. Elders were randomly assigned to Experimental (n=10) and Control (n=10) groups. During this study all individuals maintained the physical activity training of the \u201cAtividade S\u00e9nior\u201d Program, where the experimental group had a training with aerobic, flexibility and strength components, associated with stimulation. The exercise program lasted 12 weeks with a frequency of 3 times a week, with each session lasting 30 minutes. The study was pre and post-tested, with the following scales: Timed Up and Go (TUG), to check the functional capacity [3] and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to check pain level [4], with the use of body chart for identifying the site of pain. The study was submitted to the International Ethics Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO).",
        " Results ",
        "In the study population, 80% of the elderly indicated some type of back pain. Of these, 50% indicated that the pain is chronic and 81.2% indicated that the main location is low back pain. At the beginning of the study participants had a mean pain according to the VAS of 5.70; the experimental group with a mean pain score of 7.10 and the control group with an average of 4.30. After 12 weeks, the participants presented a reduction in pain level (3.78), the experimental group with a significant reduction to 3.38 (p= 0.034), and the control group also with a reduction to 3.70 (p= 0.529). Regarding the functionality, according to the TUG, the experimental group obtained the mean initial time of 21.10 +10.06 and the final time of 16.32 \u00b1 7.80 (p= 0.043), compared to the control group (p= 0.436).",

This study proposes to make content validation for primary health care and its psychometric validation, having obtained previous authorization of the author for this validation.",

        "The original scale was submitted to a panel of 5 experts. We decided to keep items with levels of agreement greater than 75%, after analysing and after making the changes suggested, we submitted the scale to a second round by the same panel of experts. The new version was used to determine its psychometric characteristics and its revalidation.",
        " Results ",
        "The PES version adapted for primary health care presents a Cronbach value of 0.905, meaning a very good internal consistency, with reasonable correlation values for each item with the total of the scale (0.315-0.685). In the analysis through the matrix of main components, only factorial loads above 0.30 were considered, so it was necessary to regroup the items by factors, other than the original scale. Considering the KMO value of 0.797, which indicates that there is a good correlation between the variables, and with a Bartlett test (1407.494, p < 0.001), we could infer that the variables are significantly correlated and consequently we can confirm the validity of the adapted scale. Between the original scale and the one obtained, we identified factors that focus on the same areas, but there was a change in the items that make up these factors. These changes are expected and show greater adequacy regarding the differences between primary and hospital health care. There are differences regarding the items that portray the nurse's functions, which is in line with the evidence that shows that the community context is generally more favourable for nurses to perform autonomous functions.",
        " Conclusions ",

Regarding the application of the AGREE II, the CPG obtained a rating of 7 in all domains, which corresponds to a high quality. The questionnaire obtained a total of 82 responses, which corresponds to a rate of 45.6% of the respondents. All of the health care professionals stated that CPG\u2019s objective is clear, relevant and agree with the content and the adequacy of the recommendations. Regarding applicability, 89% of the respondents stated that is applicable.",

This methodology allowed us to find the most recent recommendations regarding IAP prevention and adapt to a specific scenario successfully according to quality and user\u2019s evaluation. We can find a limitation of the study in the fact that the evidence supporting some of the recommendations included in the CPG is moderate, and there is a shortage of experimental studies that assess the impact of implementing each individual recommendation.

When extracted item 18 (item-total correlation 0.16), all items assumed an item-total correlation > 0.20; alpha increased (\u03b1=0.90) and KMO increased to 0.88 maintaining the stability of the Bartlett test; communalities maintained above 0.40; total variance explained by the 5 factors increased to 60.4%, but 5 factors diverged from theoretical matrix and 10 items weighed in more than one factor. Through confirmatory analysis (excluding item 18) forcing for the 2 original scale factors, we verified that 4 items had commonalities <0.30. The total variance explained after the spin fell to 43.11% and 4 items weighed in more than one factor. We explored with 3 factors, KMO maintained in 0.88, Bartlett test remained within criteria, total variance explained after de rotation stayed 49.6%. Although this structure presents 3 items weigh in more than one factor, justifies its maintenance by underlying the theoretical model. Alpha is higher to initial (\u03b1=0.90). The extraction of any item will weaken scale consistency. The most stable structure was with 3 renamed factors: 1- Personal satisfaction and self-care (8 items) (38.5% explained variance); Social Family situation (8 items) (7.4%); 3- Socio professional and economic situation (4 items) (6.5%). The fidelity of the scale is reinforced by the internal consistency of its subscales, factor 1 \u03b1=0.85; factor 2 \u03b1=0.79; factor 3 \u03b1=0.72 and by the correlation between them (0.51-0.67; p<0.01).",

Portugal has had the highest rates of new cases of HIV and AIDS infection in the European Union [2]. We found that it is not possible to stop the HIV epidemic only with medical interventions. It is vital to address in everyday life the underlying social issues that prevent people from accessing interventions for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infection, including unequal human rights, stigma and discrimination. When a person is stigmatized or unable to access services as a result of discrimination, the health of the entire community is threatened and epidemic HIV transmission continues to expand rather than to contract [3].",
        " Objective ",
        "To understand how people live with HIV/AIDS, everyday life in an island space.",
        " Methods ",
        "Qualitative study, grounded theory [4], in-depth interviews were carried out, in a convenience sample, to seropositive adults of any sexual orientation who wished to talk about their experience. Data analysis included initial coding, grouping of codes, identification of categories/subcategories and memos. Fulfilled ethical requirements and assent of an ethics committee were obtained.",
        " Results ",
        "Participants were between the ages of 25 and 67 and had primary education as well as secondary education. The analysis of the data gave rise to three categories: \u201cliving with fear\u201d, \u201csurviving\u201d and \u201cfacing fear\u201d. The data are discussed in the light of the theory of transitions [5] of how to live everyday life in an island space.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "We hope that the findings help in understanding the daily lives of people with HIV/AIDS, because in order to overcome this transition they have to reconfigure their way of living, especially when living on an Island. Realize how they face and fight in the daily life against stigma; what are the most demanding situations they face and what strategies they use. The strategies used and suggested will give subsidies to the health system and nursing professionals towards the design of new programs that will enable each patient to respond to their individual needs with the resources that each one has.",

        "The work of teaching professionals is recognized to be demanding, involving dynamic interactions with students, parents, colleagues and school authorities [1]. Teaching has been ranked as one of the most stressful profession and its nature is applicable to all professional teaching roles. Several research reports have consistently documented physical and psychological symptoms experienced by teaching professionals. Several physical complains and psychosomatic symptoms such as lower back pain, headache, voice disorders and anxiety are frequently faced by teaching professionals, both in secondary and higher education, especially in women [1-5]. Presence of psychopathology symptoms in teachers are related to their rating of children mental health behaviors [6], as well as determinants to professional burnout. Therefore, identification of psychological symptoms among teachers is relevant in secondary and higher education.",
        " Objective ",
        "To identify the prevalence of self-reported psychological symptoms; Characterize the symptoms by its dimension and determine the differences in psychological symptoms between high school teachers and higher education professors.",
        " Methods ",
        "Cross-sectional correlational study, with a non-probabilistic sample of 96 Portuguese teaching professionals. Data were collected using an on-line questionnaire composed by sociodemographic questions and the Portuguese version of Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) - 53 items covering nine symptom dimensions: Somatization, Obsession-Compulsion, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation and Psychoticism; and three indices of distress: Global Severity Index (GSI), Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), and Positive Symptom Total (PST). Ethical procedures were taken into account.",
        " Results ",
        "Teaching professionals were mostly women (70.8%), aged between 30 and 62 years old (Mean=44.8; SD=7.86), 43.8% with a bachelor degree, 27.1% diagnosed with a mental disease, and 41.1% acquainted with mental health patients. Professors (37.5%) were from different fields, including health, engineering, arts, communication, social sciences, marketing and sports. High school teachers (62.5%) were mainly from sociology, philosophy and mathematics. The most scored dimension was Obsession-Compulsion in high school teachers (Mean=1.03; SD=0.75). Globally high school teachers revealed more symptoms of distress than higher education professors. Significant differences between groups were found in Somatization, Obsession-Compulsion, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Phobic Anxiety, Psychoticism, GSI and PST (p < 0.05). In the 53 BSI items, the PST was low (Mean=19.09; SD=12.70).",

For this reason, patients must be adequately informed about their health status and about the medicines they are using. One of the most important resources of medicines information, available for patients, is the information leaflet. It provides a set of understandable information and should contribute to the appropriate and safe use of information, complementing the information given by health professionals. However, the content appears to be quite complex or too technical and the text is very dense and with a reduced font size, making it intimidating and difficult to read.",

From the point of view of the concerns related with body image, the majority, 54.7% presented no distortion of body image. However, the remaining 45.3% presented distortion of body image and among these, 16.6% presented severe distortion. From the point of view of eating habits, the results show that the sample had adequate eating habits. The majority of respondents ate 5 (36.3%) or 4 (32.6%) meals per day and for the four dimensions of the eating habits scale (quality, quantity, variety and food adequacy), the scores varied between a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5, where the highest mean value was found at the level of food variety (M = 3.62, SD = 0.53) at the lowest mean value observed was found at the level of food quality (M = 3.40, SD = 0.56). The correlations between the dimensions of the eating habits scale (quality, quantity, variety and food adequacy) and students' perceptions of body image are statistically non-significant (respectively, r = 0.099; r = 0.011; r = -0.046; r = -0.038 and p > 0.05).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Although the results show that these students have adequate eating habits, it is important to continue to study the food culture of the populations, to identify individuals at risk, to intervene from the point of view of promoting the acquisition of healthy eating habits, and to study the factors underlying the distortion of body image and its influence on students' physical and mental well-being.",

        " Results ",
        "From the results we point out: nurses innovate their practice of care through the use of nonconventional therapies of environmental, manipulative, mental-cognitive, energetic and relationship nature. The physical, social and normative environments condition the practice of these therapies; the modes of action evidence the importance they confer to the ethical aspects and the (re)combination of several techniques, result in innovative and individualized care. Nurses evaluate these therapies as very effective in various health/illness situations, emphasizing their contribution to well-being.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Conclusions and implications of the study: nurses identify a sense of high conceptual and professional coherence of nonconventional therapies with nursing, considering that they innovate and considerably increase the repertoire of practice. The innovation of Nursing practices, through the integration of these therapies, contributes to the well-being of the people cared for and enables them to better manage their health, which is relevant in an aging society.",

        " Background ",
        "The occurrence of aggressive episodes by clients in the contexts of mental health settings are recurrent, being imperative to adapt staff interventions to stabilize the psychopathological state of the client, consequently reducing the risk of injury. The de-escalation technique prevents the escalation of aggressiveness, allows a relationship of trust to be established by demonstrating understanding of the client\u2019s problems and concerns [1]. The same authors performed the psychometric validation of the English modified De-Escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale (EMDABS). This scale aims to evaluate the education/training and de-escalation skills of health professionals, based on seven items: \u201cvaluing the client; reducing fear; inquiring about client\u2019s queries and anxiety; providing guidance to the client; working out possible agreements; remaining calm; risky\u201d. The scale revealed a high level of consistency between the seven items of the de-escalation \u03b1=0.901.",
        " Objective ",
        "This study aims to translate and effect the cultural adaptation of the EMDABS scale to the Portuguese language in order to improve nursing de-escalation techniques.",
        " Methods ",
        "The translation and cultural adaptation of this instrument followed a methodological sequence: translation of the scale into Portuguese; focus group discussion; retroversion to English and pre-testing [2]. The study was authorized by the hospital ethics committee. The participants of the focus-group agreed to participate freely and clarified.",
        " Results ",
        "The first translation was carried out by two teachers, born in Portugal and fluent in English, with a Degree in Modern Languages and Literatures. Conceptual translation was privileged instead of literal translation, promoting the conservation of simple and accessible language characterized by the original instrument. The translation was evaluated by a focus group (6 professionals) with experience in the field, all participants speak Portuguese and are fluent in English, having evaluated the translation obtained and suggested necessary changes. The translation was then back-translated into the English language, by a Clinical Psychologist, from South Africa, with English native language, fluent in Portuguese, with experience in the field, as well as in the translation of evaluation instruments. This professional had no previous contact with antecedent versions of this instrument. The Pre-testing was applied to a group of ten nurses to evaluate the adequacy of the structure and items of this scale, as well as to validate eventual difficulties in filling it.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "In the pre-test, the instrument showed a good internal consistency and the participants did not present filling difficulties. The next step is to determine the psychometric properties of the scale.",

        "Informal caregivers (IC) are crucial in care provision to dependent patients, frequently aged and suffering from chronic diseases. Therefore, besides helping the dependent people carrying out daily activities, they should also provide them support and assistance in dealing with self-care difficulties.",
        " Objective ",
        "This quantitative exploratory descriptive study aims to: identify self-care needs in which the person is dependent, and the dependency degree; identify socio-demographic characteristics and ICs support to care for a dependent-person; identify the type, quality of information provided to the IC and the health-professional who delivered the information; assess the perception of ICs regarding their abilities to care for dependent-patients.",
        " Methods ",
        "An intentional sample of thirty-three dyads of dependent-patients (at least in one self-care daily activity) and their caregivers participated in this study. Participants were referred by the hospital health-care team of a hospital service, at the time of discharge. Dependent-people clinical and sociodemographic data were collected from clinical files. ICs answered a structured interview composed by sociodemographic and professional data, type of support in caring for dependent-people, ability of ICs to care for the dependent-person and to promote self-care. This study was approved by the ethic committee of the hospital where the study was conducted (n\u00ba 24/2017).",
        " Results ",
        "The majority of dependent-persons were female (60.6%) with a mean age of 81.6 (\u00b111.3) years. Regarding self-care activities, the majority of persons were dependent and did not take part in preparing medication (66.7%), preparing food for ingestion (51.5%), nor in obtaining objects for the bath (51.5%). Caregivers were mostly women, mean age of 61.4 (\u00b112.1) years old. Regarding family ties, is mostly a son/daughter (39.4%) or a spouse (33.3%) who takes care of their family member on average for 63.9 (\u00b193) months. Nurses were the main providers of information, nonetheless most of the caregivers were not provided with information about auxiliary equipment (79.3%) nor economic support available (71.0%). ICs feel less competent in caring for a dependent-person regarding ability to transfer. Ability to dress was the area in which the dependent-person presented the highest degree of dependence. Regarding \u201cfeeding\u201d, ICs refer the identification of signs of malnutrition and dehydration as the main difficulty.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Supporting families in acquiring practical problem-solving skills in every day\u2019s life, in the management of resources and of emotional needs of the dependent-person should be promoted by health-professionals at the beginning of hospitalization, in order to take good care of the family member and of oneself.",

        " Background ",
        "The Primary Health Care reform and the introduction of Health Centre Groupings brought changes in the management standards in force until then. The new model care reorganized and changed work contexts and human resources. The new organizational paradigm requires adaptation of the professionals to this new reality. In any situation of change people reacts with resistance in greater or lesser intensity. Also changes in organizations can create resistances that can manifest themselves with absenteeism. In health organizations the absenteeism of nurses constitutes a complex problem and needs to be valued and monitored by nursing managers [1].",
        " Objective ",
        "To identify the presence and causes of absenteeism and analyse the relationship between absenteeism and demographic and professional variables.",
        " Methods ",
        "Quantitative, exploratory and cross study was used as methodology. A sociodemographic/professional questionnaire and questions related to absenteeism were used for the collection of data. The sample was composed by 109 nurses working at primary health care units of northern Portugal. The sample was composed by 77.1% of females, 54.1% aged more than 36 years, 72.5% married, 82.6% working on fixed schedules, 51.4% with nearly 14 years of job experience (varied between 7 and 33 years), and 81.7% considered their job as stressful.",
        " Results ",
        "Of all nurses, 66% admitted to having been absent from service in the last year: 28.4% due to their own illness and 16.5% due to their relatives\u2019 illness. Statistically, there were found significant differences in the association between the variables of to have children (p = 0.007), place of work (p = 0.045) and absenteeism. We also found that nurses with children and those who work in Health Family Units are the ones that are absent from work most frequently.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "We believe that the results can induce the development, implementation and evaluation of preventive measures, aiming at the promotion and protection of nurses' health. In this regard, they can be crucial for the management of human resources and for strategic planning of the ACeS, in particular, in grounded decision-making.",

        "Mental illness can have profound repercussions in family dynamics, since it is a serious illness and generates great stress. The assessment and intervention of a family with psychosocial problems requires the nursing team to use models that allow the design of care oriented both for data collection and for the planning of interventions in domiciliary context.",

        " Methods ",
        "The case study focused on the process of family intervention developed with a family in a domiciliary context in Primary Health Care, according to MDAIF. The following data collection instruments were applied: genogram, ecomap, FACES II, Graffar and Family Apgar Scales.",
        " Results ",
        "The family consists of a middle-aged couple, childless, lower middle class (grade IV, Graffar, 1956). The woman is the main care provider of her husband, with mental illness. They have an extensive network of community support, namely in Social Solidarity Institutions, Recreational Associations, the extended family and the Community Care Unit (health team). As a couple, they show good cohesion and adaptability facing everyday problems (Faces II Scale) and perceive their family as highly functional (score 10 - Apgar Scale), despite the perception of communicational difficulties and emotional expression. After the interventions of the nursing team, in the different dimensions of the MDAIF, gains were obtained in the knowledge and capacity of income management, heating system of the residential building, management and knowledge about the mental illness, communication and marital satisfaction and the role of caregiver. In this way, the caregiver has been trained in knowledge and skills in the field of care for the dependent person and with mental pathology, in order to maximize their health, as well as in the care and importance of the satisfaction of her own needs.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The valuation of caregiver perspectives is essential for the adjustment of the formal responses of the nursing team. Empowerment of family caregivers - as well as being able to express themselves and be an active element in the healthcare process, as well as the articulation of formal and informal responses constitute challenges for health professionals. The support provided by the health team to the caregiver and dependent patient has proved to be effective not only in improving family functioning but also in reducing stress, burnout and isolation of the caregiver.",

        " Background ",
        "The aging process implementation in Portugal, and the consequent increase in the number of elderly people is evident and constitutes an increasing process. Undeniably, the elderly people are the main users of health services and specifically physiotherapy services. The economic and financial crisis that affected Portugal, has imposed restrictions on the health system and specifically on the National Health Service (NHS) [1]. Considering this scenario, we have put as a guiding question: Are, in Portugal, physiotherapy health services and human resources included in the health system at NUTS III regional level, and essentially in the NHS, proportional to the number of elderly people and respond to their current and future needs? [NUTS III - Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) with level III corresponding to the territorial division constituted by 30 regions, according to the division of 2013].",
        " Objective ",
        "We aim to understand the current and future numbers of the elderly people at the regional level (NUTS III); to know the current number of physiotherapy services and human resources at the same regional level; to prospective the future physical therapy services and human resources, considering the health political trends related to services and human resources; and to assess if these services and human resources respond to the needs of the current and future elderly people.",
        " Methods ",
        "For this purpose, we performed a statistical analysis at the regional level NUTS III, considering the indicators - number of elderly people and physical therapy services and human resources. We used the data from the Statistics National Institute, the Health Regulatory Body, the Portuguese Physiotherapists Union and the Portuguese Association of Physiotherapists.",
        " Results ",
        "The results showed that at the regional level (NUTS III), physiotherapy services and human resources are scarce and there is no proportionality between the number of elderly people and the physiotherapy services and human resources. With the increasing number of elderly people and the restrictive political trend, we assume that, if the political trends continue, proportionality will remain non-existent.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "In this way, we conclude that current and future physiotherapy services and human resources do not respond to the needs of the current and future elderly population, and there is a need to adapt physiotherapy services and human resources to the current and future demographic reality, in order to achieve better levels of healthy life expectancy.",

There were no significant differences in the variances between groups.",
        " Conclusions ",

We concluded that the percentage of fat measured by bone densitometry does not correlate with the thickness of subcutaneous tissue, with the percentage of fat being higher in overweight women but the thickness of subcutaneous tissue varies from woman to woman. The only possible relationship is between the bone mineral density and the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue of the right gluteus that leads to force that the greater the thickness the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the greater the bone mineral density, because although they are structurally different both respond to the stimuli of atrophy and hypertrophy.",
