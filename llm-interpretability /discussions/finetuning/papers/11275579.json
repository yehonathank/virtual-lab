        "The global onslaught of lung diseases, notably bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, tuberculosis, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, has starkly highlighted the limitations of current healthcare systems in managing such conditions effectively. The mortality rates associated with these diseases, compounded by the emergence of COVID-19, have not only resulted in a significant loss of life but have also imposed considerable economic burdens worldwide. The pandemic has exacerbated the complexities of lung disease diagnosis and management, especially in patients with co-morbidities like diabetes and neurological disorders, which can dramatically increase the severity of COVID-19. The resulting condition, often referred to as long COVID, is characterized by a prolonged battle between the body\u2019s immune response, including elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as well as the virus. This ongoing conflict weakens the immune system, making the body more susceptible to environmental factors and further complicating lung conditions.",
        "Chest computed tomography (CT) scans are important for thoroughly evaluating lung diseases by providing comprehensive high-resolution pictures that help accurately identify anatomical structures and characterize diseases. Yet, their effectiveness is greatly hindered by their expensive operational costs, complex infrastructure needs, and the necessity for specialized technical skills. These factors combined result in their scarce availability and restricted access, particularly in remote and resource-limited areas. This gap highlights the pressing need for diagnostic approaches that are more economically feasible and widely accessible. Chest radiographs, or chest X-rays (CXRs), are a more practical choice since they are less expensive, need fewer resources, and are more widely accessible in various healthcare settings. However, CXRs present specific difficulties, particularly due to the tendency for image noise, which may obstruct important diagnostic information and make the interpretation process more complex. Moreover, depending on human experience to analyze these radiographs increases subjectivity, which might result in variability in diagnosis results. This variation is due to variations in observer expertise, perceptual understanding, and cognitive exhaustion, which can impact the accuracy and reliability of diagnoses made from CXR assessments. The intersection of these factors complicates the diagnostic process and emphasizes the need for new methods to reduce these restrictions, improving the accuracy and accessibility of diagnosing and managing pulmonary diseases.",
        "In response to these pressing challenges, we propose an innovative, low-cost artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostic system that leverages deep learning (DL) technologies to automate the analysis of CXRs. This system aims to overcome the limitations of manual interpretation by utilizing advanced algorithms for lung segmentation and disease classification, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lung disease diagnosis. Our approach employs a diverse array of models, combining the strengths of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with cutting-edge architectures. Specifically, we utilize ResNet 50 and Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG 16) for their DL capabilities in feature extraction, EfficientNet-B7 for its scalability and efficiency in handling complex image data, and Inception V3 for its inception modules that allow for a wider network with fewer parameters. Alongside these, we incorporate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their ability to capture global context, ViT Large for its enhanced capacity in processing detailed image features, and DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformers) for its efficiency in training with fewer data. Additionally, we explore hybrid models such as MobileViT, which combines the perceptual benefits of ViTs with the efficiency of CNNs, offering a comprehensive solution for detailed image analysis and robust disease classification in lung diseases.",
        "The proposed study focuses on the premise that incorporating ViTs with self-attention processes will provide better diagnostic accuracy than conventional CNN models. ViTs have the ability to evaluate pictures as sequences of patches, which allows for a detailed comprehension of specific aspects important for precise illness categorization. We have created a comprehensive experimental protocol to validate our approach. This includes comparing model performance with and without lung segmentation, examining attention mechanisms, and conducting thorough statistical analysis with methods like Tukey\u2019s Honestly Significant Difference and McNemar test, as well as many more statistical tests. The utilization of explainability methods such as Grad-CAM++ and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) will offer vital insights into the decision-making mechanisms of our models, clarifying the AI \u201cblack box\u201d and building trust in AI-based diagnostics. By bridging the gap between advanced AI technologies and clinical practice, our system not only aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of lung disease detection but also to make these advancements accessible and understandable to clinicians and patients alike. This initiative represents a significant step forward in the utilization of AI in healthcare, promising to revolutionize the diagnosis of lung diseases and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.",

        "The history of lung disease detection has been marked by significant advancements, yet it has always faced challenges. Initially, CXRs and CT scans were the primary modalities used for diagnosing lung diseases. While chest CT scans provided high-resolution images essential for detailed anatomical evaluations, their high cost and the need for specialized technical expertise made them less accessible, particularly in resource-limited settings. Chest X-rays, although more affordable and widely available, were subject to image noise and variability in interpretation making accurate diagnosis challenging and highly dependent on the radiologist\u2019s expertise.",
        "The advent of machine learning (ML) brought a positive shift in medical imaging, aiming to reduce subjectivity and improve diagnostic accuracy. Early ML applications focused on automating image analysis tasks, which showed promise in enhancing diagnostic procedures. However, the inherent limitations of CXRs, such as poor contrast and difficulty in extracting borders, posed significant challenges. These issues often led to inconsistent results, thereby limiting the clinical success of ML-based approaches in lung disease diagnosis. The evolution of DL marked a pivotal moment in the field of medical imaging. CNNs emerged as powerful tools for image segmentation and classification. CNNs, with their ability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from data, significantly improved the accuracy of lung disease detection from medical images. They were particularly effective in tasks like nodule detection, pneumonia classification, and tuberculosis screening, outperforming traditional ML methods. Despite their success, CNNs had limitations in capturing global contextual information, which sometimes affected their performance in complex image analysis tasks.",
        "To address the limitations of CNNs, ViTs were introduced. ViTs leverage self-attention mechanisms to analyze images as sequences of patches, similar to how natural language processing models handle text. This approach allows ViTs to capture global contextual information more effectively than CNNs. ViTs have shown promise in generating detailed and interpretable heatmaps for lesion detection and segmentation, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Their ability to provide a holistic view of the image makes them particularly suitable for complex medical imaging tasks. Explainability in AI diagnostics is vital for transparency, with methods like Grad-CAM++ and LRP providing visual insights into model predictions, enhancing trust and clinical acceptance. Despite progress in AI for lung disease diagnosis, gaps remain in integrating CNNs, ViTs, and advanced explainability methods. This study addresses these gaps through comprehensive model comparisons, explainability techniques, and rigorous statistical evaluations, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a DL pipeline tailored for enhancing the accuracy of medical imaging diagnostics, particularly in detecting lung diseases through CXR, illustrated in Figure 1. The pipeline begins with rigorous data curation, which includes preprocessing and applying Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), ensuring that models like ViTs and CNNs are robust and generalizable. Next, we employ the Attention U-Net model for lung region segmentation, critical for accurately localizing pathology. This is followed by a classification phase where the unique strengths of ViTs and CNNs are harnessed to differentiate between various lung disease manifestations, aiming to boost classification accuracy. The pipeline concludes with an explainability assessment to clarify the decision-making processes of the models by analyzing generated heatmaps, ensuring the interpretability of the findings. A rigorous set of experimental protocols with comprehensive metrics and statistical analysis supports this methodology, demonstrating that ViTs can enhance explainability without sacrificing segmentation or classification quality. This integrative approach marks a significant step forward in leveraging DL for improved clinical decision making in radiology. Furthermore, our framework\u2019s adaptability allows for the future integration of additional diagnostic modalities, expanding its utility in clinical practice.",
        "In this research, we utilize a meticulously curated CXR dataset with 12,000 images encompassing a spectrum of pulmonary conditions, including normal cases with no apparent pulmonary pathology, bacterial pneumonia characterized by bacterial infections, viral pneumonia indicating viral infections, tuberculosis with radiographic signs typical of TB, and COVID-19 marked by features such as ground-glass opacities and consolidation, as shown in Figure 2. Each set in the image contains unique chest X-rays and consists of two rows: the first row shows the original input images, and the second row displays the images processed with CLAHE. These images were sourced from three distinct Kaggle databases, each acknowledged for its specialized collection that contributes to the broad spectrum of medical conditions represented, where the input and resultant CLAHE-enhanced images are juxtaposed to illustrate the method\u2019s impact. The CLAHE process is pivotal for augmenting image contrast, which in turn renders subtle pulmonary details more conspicuous, significantly improving the detectability and classification accuracy of lung diseases. The figure accentuates how CLAHE amplifies the visibility of lesions, underscoring its significance in our preprocessing regimen. Post-preprocessing, the dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring an even representation of various lung pathologies across each subset to facilitate a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of the model\u2019s performance. The meticulous preparation of datasets is essential for improving DL model\u2019s capacity to generalize, from the initial data acquisition through to explainability and performance evaluation.

It is essential to include the standard ViT to analyze the fundamental characteristics of Transformer-based image analysis, such as the performance advantages and interpretability provided by its self-attention layers.",
        "Figure 4 illustrates the basic architecture of a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base), a model that applies transformer principles, extensively used in natural language processing, for image recognition. The procedure begins by partitioning the input image into patches of a certain size and then mapping these patches to a lower-dimensional space via linear transformation. Positional embeddings are then used to maintain the spatial information of each patch. The embedded patches serve as the input sequence for the transformer encoder, including alternating layers of multi-head self-attention and multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks. Normalization layers follow each layer and include residual connections to facilitate gradient flow in training. The output of the transformer encoder is sent into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head, sometimes known as the class head. The head consists of interconnected layers that provide categorization predictions. The ViT architecture, created by Dosovitskiy et al., is known for its ability to capture long-range dependencies in images and adapt well to various model sizes, marking a significant advancement in computer vision.",

        "Figure 5 depicts the creation of a DeiT model. DeiT improves the ViT approach by adding a distillation token to the class token, enabling it to learn from a pre-trained instructor model without the need for extensive datasets. The input image is first segmented into patches and then converted into embeddings by linear projection, similar to the procedure in ViT. The embeddings, class token, and distillation token undergo processing in a sequence of blocks inside the transformer. Each block has a self-attention mechanism to determine the importance of patches and a feed-forward network to analyze patch embeddings. Layer normalization is applied before each component in the transformer encoder structure, followed by a residual connection after each. The class token gathers data from the image and is used for the final classification prediction (L_ce) in accordance with the standard procedure in ViT. The distillation token is a new addition designed to enhance the extraction of information from the teacher model (L_teacher). It is inspired by knowledge distillation, a process where a smaller student model mimics the behavior of a larger, more complex model. DeiT can effectively train with less datasets compared to ViT, which often requires large amounts of data to perform well. The inclusion of the distillation token in the DeiT model showcases the architecture\u2019s unique approach to improving training data efficiency, addressing a key challenge in using transformers for computer vision tasks.",

The network starts by inputting an image and using a standard convolutional layer (Conv 3 \u00d7 3) with a stride of 2. This reduces the resolution to 128 \u00d7 128 and captures low-level information. The approach utilizes MobileNetV2 (MV2) blocks with depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational expenses while maintaining representational effectiveness beyond the first convolution. The MV2 blocks are used sequentially, with each block reducing the image\u2019s resolution by a factor of 2, leading to a steady decrease in spatial size over the stages (64 \u00d7 64, then 32 \u00d7 32). In Figure 6, the forward arrow represents the sequence of operations, while the down arrow indicates downsampling, which reduces the image size. After each group of MV2 blocks, a MobileViT block is included. The blocks use transformer-based self-attention methods tailored for mobile applications by confining the self-attention to tiny windows (h = w = 2) rather than the whole feature map. The network\u2019s tight focus allows it to capture important geographical links while effectively managing computer resources. The MobileViT blocks are structured hierarchically with different depths (L = 2, L = 4, L = 3) to allow the network to capture features at different scales.",
