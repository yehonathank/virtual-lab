        "Medical physics has always been the forefront in implementing novel scientific discoveries and innovative technologies into the field of medicine. The origin of medical physics extends back to as early as 3000\u20132500 BC (Keevil). In the history of modern medical physics, one of the most important milestones was the discovery of x-ray by Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen. The use of x-ray has revolutionized medical diagnostics and treatment. There are numerous other examples in the medical physics history book that significantly transformed medical practice, including the application of radiation therapy for cancer, the development of the gamma camera, the advent of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the invention of computed tomography (CT), and the advancement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), among others. Recently, there is a growing consensus that artificial intelligence (AI) is starting the fourth industrial revolution. Therefore, the integration of AI into medicine is of great interest to the medical physics community.",
        "Over the past decade, deep learning (DL), a branch of AI, has experienced a significant surge in development and has found widespread applications, including autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, natural language processing, and medical diagnostics. DL models, categorized by data modality\u2014vision, language, and sensor\u2014have seen rapid development in vision and language owing to their adaptability and efficiency. Vision models, interpreting and processing visual data, have transformed medical imaging by improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in organ delineation (Pan et al ), advancing early disease detection (Lee et al , Li et al ), achieving high-quality medical image synthesis (Lei et al , Lei et al , Yamashita and Markov, Pan et al ) and facilitating personalized treatment plans (Florkow et al ). By utilizing the capabilities of vision models, the paradigm of medical imaging has shifted from conventional methods to AI-driven techniques, leading to improved patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.",
        "Conversely, language models (LMs), designed to understand, interpret, and generate human languages, have undergone significant advancements in recent years. These models have transformed various sectors by enabling more sophisticated text analysis, improving language translation systems, and enhancing user interaction with technology through natural language processing (NLP). Despite the extensive deployment and rapid progression of LMs in applications such as customer service chatbots, automated content creation, and language translation services, their integration into medical domains, particularly medical imaging, has not captured the researchers\u2019 attention until recently due to several factors. Firstly, medical reports are replete with specialized terminology that requires precise interpretation and thorough analysis to ensure accurate and effective communication. Historically, LMs have encountered challenges in comprehending and utilizing the intricate medical terminology and subtleties essential for accurate medical diagnosis and effective patient care. Secondly, developing robust models requires large amounts of data and comprehensive corpora, which are difficult to obtain in the medical imaging domain due to stringent privacy regulations and the inherently confidential nature of medical records. This scarcity of accessible, annotated medical datasets has hindered the development and fine-tuning of LMs for medical applications. Thirdly, certain applications in medical imaging require an integration of vision and language models, known as vision-language models, which presents significant challenges, including ensuring coherent and meaningful correlations between image content and textual descriptions and adapting models to interpret medical images, which often contain highly specialized and nuanced information. Lastly, there is a noticeable deficit of comprehensive review literature that could help inspiring collaboration between researchers and medical professionals, which can lead to board applications for LMs in medical imaging.",
        "The recent surge in interest towards LMs in the medical imaging is attributed to several key developments. One of the pivotal factors catalyzing this trend is the release of large-scale language models by several tech companies, as shown in figure 1, which exhibit exceptional proficiency in parsing and generating complex language structures. This breakthrough has prompted researchers to explore potential applications of LMs in medical imaging. Another contributing factor is the wide accessibility of these advanced pre-trained large models, engineered for immediate application or minimal customization, aligns well with the specialized requirements of medical imaging tasks. Such flexibility is advantageous for medical imaging applications, where specialized tasks can often be addressed with slight modifications to existing models by finetuning on domain-specific datasets, thus yielding more targeted and effective applications within medical contexts. Moreover, the emergence of multimodal large language models, GPT-4-V, has significantly reduced the complexity of adopting vision-language models in medical imaging. These models offer an integrated framework that merges visual and linguistic analytics capabilities, thus streamlining the interpretative process of medical images which frequently requires a combination of visual and textual analysis.",

        " Mean reciprocal rank (MRR): Averages the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant answer in a list of possibilities.",
        " CIDEr (consensus-based image description evaluation): CIDEr serves as an evaluative metric for image captioning that quantifies the quality and diversity of the generated captions. It gauges the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores for n-grams in both reference and generated captions and subsequently derives a consensus score. An elevated CIDEr score signifies an improvement in caption quality and diversity.",
        " CLIPScore (contrastive language\u2013image pre-training score): CLIPScore is a tool designed to evaluate the correspondence between image descriptions and image content. It is particularly suitable for models such as CLIP. The tool leverages the CLIP model to embed the generated descriptions and images into a common semantic space and computes the cosine similarity between these embeddings. A higher CLIPScore indicates that the quality of the generated descriptions is better in terms of matching the visual content of the images.",
        "Comprehending the evaluation metrics for language models in medical imaging is of utmost importance. As our readership comprises a diverse group of professionals, ranging from machine learning researchers to medical physicists and physicians, an in-depth understanding of these metrics is critical for this broad audience. In this subsection, we present a list of these metrics and expound on their interpretation, laying the foundation for quantitatively understanding the performance of language models for medical imaging. ",
        "Before the Transformer era, statistical and early neural network approaches dominated the landscape of language models. The most common of these were N-gram models, which used preceding words to predict the likelihood of the next word. However, these models were limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies and were affected by data sparsity issues.",
        "Later, probabilistic frameworks like hidden markov models (HMMs) (Rabiner) were introduced, offering improved sequence modeling, but still struggled with the complexities of natural language. The introduction of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber), marked a significant milestone as they could capture information over longer sequences, which earlier models could not. However, RNNs faced challenges like the vanishing gradient problem, which limited their efficacy in processing very long sequences.",
        "This period before the Transformer models is crucial as it sets the foundation for developing them. The efforts of this era helped overcome several limitations in language modeling. They paved the way for developing more sophisticated models used today in various fields, such as medical imaging.",
        "Transformers, introduced by Vaswani et al have revolutionized the field of natural language processing with their innovative model architecture. They have surpassed traditional recurrent or convolutional encoder\u2013decoder models. The key enhancement brought by attention mechanisms has significantly optimized the performance of encoder\u2013decoder models. The Transformer model, the pioneering model that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms for input and output representations, has outperformed both recurrent and convolutional neural networks. A notable advantage of the Transformer model is its ability to be trained in parallel, resulting in reduced training time. The encoder is composed of six identical blocks, each consisting of two sub-layers, a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and a fully connected feed-forward network. Similarly, the decoder comprises six identical blocks, each incorporating three sub-layers, including the addition of a multi-head self-attention sub-layer. The self-attention mechanism employed by the Transformer model utilizes a scaled dot-product attention approach. It involves multiplying the query and key vectors and applying a SoftMax function to obtain weightings for the output. Although both additive and dot-product attention are common attention functions, dot-product attention is favored for its superior space efficiency and faster computation, thanks to the utilization of highly optimized matrix multiplication code. A key aspect of the transformative impact of Transformers is their role as the foundational architecture for subsequent advanced language models. Models such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), generative pretrained transformer (GPT), T5 (Text-to-text transfer transformer) (Raffel et al ), bidirectional and auto-regressive transformers (BART) (Lewis et al ), and XLNet (Yang et al ) owe their genesis to the Transformer architecture shown as figure 3.",

Importantly, RadLing offers practical benefits such as local deployment and cost-efficiency, making it a promising tool for structured information extraction in radiology.",
        "In some cases, extracting intricate spatial details from the radiology report presents greater challenges. The research employs two methods for extracting spatial triggers from radiology reports. The baseline method used a BERTBASE model, fine-tuned on the annotated corpus, treating it as a sequence labeling task. The proposed hybrid method included candidate trigger generation through exact matching and domain-specific constraints, followed by a BERT-based classification model to determine correctness. Both methods used BERTBASE, pre-trained on MIMIC-III clinical notes, and the evaluation includes rule-based approaches. While the sequence labeling method had high precision but low recall, exact matching improved recall significantly but resulted in many false positives. Applying constraints to exact matched triggers enhanced precision slightly. However, the hybrid approach, which combined domain-inspired constraints with a BERT-based classifier, achieved both balanced precision and recall. It exhibited an impressive 24-point improvement in F1 score compared to standard BERT sequence labeling, with an average accuracy of 88.7% over 10-fold cross-validation.",

Furthermore, LMs can be applied to generate accurate and readable reports from various types of medical images to improve clinical workflow efficiency, reduce diagnostic errors, and assist healthcare professionals in providing timely and accurate diagnoses. LMs also demonstrated their application in visual question answering, patient/medical student education, pre-diagnosis screening, protocol determination, and more.",
        "Although LMs have achieved remarkable performance in the fields mentioned above, reaching a level that can rival (Buckley et al , Rau et al ) or even surpass (Naik et al , Russe et al ) human, it is undeniable that LMs are far from being able to fully automate the medical imaging process, let alone operate without human expert supervision. To ensure that our readers can effectively and responsibly utilize these LMs as tools, it is essential for us to discuss the limitations of existing LMs for medical imaging methods and the potential risks they may pose in this context. Additionally, we will examine and provide insights into possible future directions for development in this field.",
        "In the context of LMs for medical imaging, the foremost concerns revolve around data quality and data accessibility. The efficacy of these models is heavily contingent on the caliber of the data used for training, encompassing not just data accuracy and relevance but also its capacity to encompass a wide array of medical scenarios. High-quality data is instrumental in ensuring precise and dependable model predictions, a prerequisite for informed clinical decision-making. Nonetheless, the medical field frequently grapples with data quality challenges stemming from issues such as inconsistent annotation, variations in medical imaging protocols, and the presence of artifacts. Simultaneously, data accessibility presents another formidable obstacle. Stringent privacy regulations and ethical considerations pertaining to patient data substantially restrict the availability of expansive and varied datasets.

Consequently, the development of robust LMs for medical imaging demands a concerted endeavor to elevate both the quality and accessibility of medical data. This may encompass the establishment of standardized protocols for data collection and annotation, fostering collaborative data sharing initiatives that respect privacy, and implementing techniques like synthetic data generation to mitigate the challenges posed by the scarcity of real-world data. Effectively addressing these issues is pivotal for unlocking the full potential of LMs in reshaping medical imaging and advancing patient care.",
        "The integration of language models in medical imaging raises significant concerns regarding privacy and security. These concerns are twofold: the protection of sensitive patient data and the security of the models against malicious use.",
        "Privacy concerns primarily stem from the need to handle sensitive patient information, including medical histories, diagnostic images, and personal identifiers. The use of this data in training and operating language models poses risks, such as unauthorized access or data breaches, leading to potential violations of patient confidentiality. These risks are exacerbated by the large-scale data requirements of language models, which often necessitate aggregating data from multiple sources, increasing the likelihood of exposure. Moreover, the potential for residual information from training data to be inferred from the model\u2019s outputs adds another layer of privacy challenges. Ensuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA in the U.S. or GDPR in Europe is crucial for maintaining patient trust and legal conformity.",
        "Security concerns are equally critical. The materials indicate a risk of adversarial attacks (Qiu et al ), where malicious inputs are designed to deceive the model into making incorrect predictions or revealing sensitive information. In the context of medical imaging, this could mean manipulating an image to mislead a diagnosis or extracting patient data embedded in the model. The increasing sophistication of these attacks necessitates robust defense mechanisms to ensure the integrity and reliability of the models.",
        "Addressing these privacy and security challenges requires a multifaceted approach. For privacy, implementing stringent data anonymization techniques and secure data handling protocols is essential. Regular audits and compliance checks can also ensure ongoing adherence to privacy standards. For security, incorporating advanced adversarial defense mechanisms in the model\u2019s architecture and continuous monitoring for potential threats are necessary. Additionally, fostering a culture of ethical AI use and implementing strong legal frameworks will be crucial in safeguarding against misuse and maintaining public trust in these advanced technologies.",
        "Medical imaging, such as MRI, CT scans, or x-rays, involves complex visual data that can be challenging to interpret even by trained professionals. When language models like ChatGPT are employed in this context, the interpretability of these models is crucial because it directly impacts clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. The \u2018black box\u2019 (Mannarswamy and Chidambaram) nature of models like ChatGPT becomes a significant hurdle here. Understanding the basis on which these models draw such conclusions is often not straightforward. This lack of transparency can be a major barrier in clinical settings where the rationale behind each decision can be as crucial as the decision itself.",
        "To bridge this gap, there is a need for more interpretability in medical imaging. This could involve integrating medical vision models with LMs in a way that allows for traceable and understandable decision-making processes (Tanida et al , Yan et al ). For instance, combining image recognition models that provide annotated images highlighting areas of interest with language models that can explain these annotations in a clinically relevant context. Additionally, developing methods for these models to provide reasoning in a manner akin to clinical thought processes can enhance their utility and trustworthiness.",
        "LMs\u2019 effectiveness may substantially increase when coupled with the expertise of medical professionals (Tanida et al , Wang et al ). In the nuanced and high-stakes field of medical imaging, the knowledge and experience of clinicians, radiologists, and medical physicist are critical in guiding and refining the outputs of LMs. Human oversight ensures the contextual accuracy of LM interpretations, aligning them with the intricacies of individual patient cases and the broader clinical picture. This collaboration is crucial for mitigating potential errors, biases, or oversights that might arise solely from automated processes. Moreover, human experts play a pivotal role in integrating LM insights into practical clinical decision-making, ensuring that the technology is harnessed responsibly and ethically. Thus, the synergy between LMs and human expertise in medical imaging not only enhances diagnostic accuracy and efficiency but also upholds the standards of patient care and safety.",

On one hand, restricted access to such advanced models could limit innovation in medical imaging, as researchers and clinicians might not have the opportunity to experiment with, adapt, and integrate these models into their work. This limitation could slow down the pace of discovery and implementation of new, AI-enhanced diagnostic and analytical methods. On the other hand, the proprietary nature of these models can also drive quality and safety, as the companies behind them invest in extensive research, development, and testing to ensure their reliability and efficacy. Furthermore, proprietary models might have more robust governance and ethical frameworks, as companies are accountable to regulatory bodies and stakeholders. However, this can lead to a concentration of technological advancement within certain entities, potentially creating disparities in the field. The ideal scenario may involve a balance between proprietary and open-source models, where proprietary models ensure quality and reliability, while open-source alternatives promote wider accessibility and collaborative innovation in the medical imaging community.",
        "Model biases in LMs arise from the data they are trained on, which may contain inherent biases related to demographics such as race, gender, or socio-economic status. These biases can be inadvertently transferred into the models\u2019 predictions and analyses, potentially leading to skewed or unfair outcomes in medical diagnostics and treatment recommendations. For example, a language model trained predominantly on data from a specific demographic might underperform or yield less accurate predictions for patient populations outside that demographic. This scenario highlights the need for inclusive and diverse training datasets in the development of LMs for medical imaging. Hallucinations, another challenge, refer to instances where LMs generate plausible yet inaccurate or misleading information (Sallam). This aspect is particularly concerning in medical settings, where factual accuracy is paramount. Such inaccuracies might arise due to the LM\u2019s design to prioritize cohesive language generation over factual correctness. For instance, an LM might generate a coherent but medically inaccurate interpretation of an imaging report, leading to potential misdiagnoses. Both biases and hallucinations underscore the necessity for rigorous validation, continuous monitoring, and the involvement of medical experts in the application of LMs in medical imaging, ensuring that the outputs are not only plausible but also clinically accurate and unbiased.",
        "Fine-tuning, a process where pre-trained models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 are further trained on specific datasets, allows for the adaptation of LMs to the nuances of medical imaging. This process tailors LMs to understand and interpret complex medical terminologies, patient reports, and imaging data, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant outcomes. For instance, models like ClinicalBERT (Yan and Pei), which is fine-tuned with medical texts, demonstrate improved performance in understanding clinical documentation and patient notes. Domain-specific LMs, on the other hand, are designed from the outset with a focus on a particular area of medicine. They incorporate specialized knowledge and are trained on targeted datasets, making them inherently more adept at handling the intricacies of specific medical fields, such as radiology or pathology. Such models can profoundly impact patient diagnosis and treatment planning by providing more precise and insightful analyses of medical images and reports.",
        "The lack of effective evaluation metrics for language models in medical imaging poses a significant challenge in assessing their practical applicability and efficacy. Current evaluation approaches often fail to capture the nuanced requirements of medical imaging tasks, focusing predominantly on generic metrics that may not reflect the model\u2019s performance in real-world clinical scenarios. For instance, while accuracy, precision, and recall are standard metrics, they might not adequately address the complexity of medical diagnostics where understanding subtle variations in imaging is crucial. Additionally, these models are frequently assessed in controlled experimental settings or on benchmark datasets that might not represent the diversity and complexity of actual clinical cases, including rare conditions or diverse patient demographics. This gap in evaluation can lead to an overestimation of a model\u2019s readiness for clinical deployment, potentially overlooking critical shortcomings such as its ability to handle multimodal data or its performance across different demographics. Hence, there is a pressing need for developing more comprehensive and clinically relevant benchmarks that encompass a broader spectrum of medical imaging challenges. These benchmarks should ideally include diverse patient populations, varied medical conditions, and real-world clinical scenarios, offering a more holistic assessment of a model\u2019s capabilities and limitations.",
        "In conclusion, this paper has highlighted the potential of language models in advancing medical imaging analysis. We have discussed the challenges and opportunities in using language models for healthcare applications and provided an educational tutorial for researchers in this field. Our hope is that this paper will serve as an inspiration for researchers to innovate and develop new approaches to using language models to improve medical imaging analysis. We encourage researchers in the medical imaging domain to draw insights from this review and use it as a launchpad for further exploration of the possibilities of language models in healthcare. With continued research and development, we believe that language models will play an increasingly important role in improving patient outcomes and advancing medical research."
