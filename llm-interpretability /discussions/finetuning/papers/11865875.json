        "Rare diseases occur in <50 per 100000 people and require lifelong management. However, essential epidemiological data on such diseases are lacking, and a consecutive monitoring system across time and regions remains to be established. Standardized digital phenotypes are required to leverage an international data network for research on rare endocrine diseases. We developed digital phenotypes for rare endocrine diseases using the observational medical outcome partnership common data model.",
        "Digital phenotypes of three rare endocrine diseases (medullary thyroid cancer, hypoparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma) were validated across three databases that use different vocabularies: Severance Hospital\u2019s electronic health record from South Korea; IQVIA\u2019s United Kingdom (UK) database for general practitioners; and IQVIA\u2019s United States (US) hospital database for general hospitals. We estimated the performance of different digital phenotyping methods based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 in the UK and the US or systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms (SNOMED CT) in Korea.",
        "The positive predictive value of digital phenotyping was higher using SNOMED CT-based phenotyping than ICD-10-based phenotyping for all three diseases in Korea (e.g., pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma: ICD-10, 58%\u201362%; SNOMED CT, 89%). Estimated incidence rates by digital phenotyping were as follows: medullary thyroid cancer, 0.34\u20132.07 (Korea), 0.13\u20130.30 (US); hypoparathyroidism, 0.40\u20131.20 (Korea), 0.59\u20131.01 (US), 0.00\u20131.78 (UK); and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, 0.95\u20131.67 (Korea), 0.35\u20130.77 (US), 0.00\u20130.49 (UK).",
        "Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing digital phenotyping of rare endocrine diseases and highlight the importance of implementing SNOMED CT in routine clinical practice to provide granularity for research.",
        "Rare diseases, which occur in <50 per 100000 people, require continuous and often lifelong management, and consume substantial medical resources. More than 6000 rare diseases affect approximately 30 million individuals across Europe and the United States (US). Together, lack of awareness, data scarcity regarding the disease burden, progress and complications, and a limited number of specialists, prolong the diagnostic period by approximately 4 years, a phenomenon termed \u201cdiagnostic odyssey\u201d. Due to the challenges in diagnosis and the lack of cost-effectiveness in research caused by their rarity, large investment in infrastructure for epidemiological studies of rare diseases seems remote. Although more than 440 rare endocrine diseases exist across a wide range of organs including pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands, ovaries, testes, and bones, essential epidemiological data on these diseases remain lacking. For example, the prevalence of nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism has been reported in approximately five countries, but no accurate incidence has been reported.",
        "Observational data from multiple healthcare resources, such as electronic health records (EHR), can provide evidence for rare diseases. In addition, strengthening global research and collaboration by connecting medical specialists and their data offers opportunities to improve care for rare diseases. However, the explosive growth of available data in healthcare has not supported a consecutive surveillance system for rare diseases across time and regions owing to inconsistencies in data format, semantic heterogeneity, and lack of consensus on digital phenotypes. The common data model (CDM), which standardized data contained in different databases into a standardized format with a standardized vocabulary, can address this problem. Converting multiple heterogeneous databases to CDM allows researchers to execute identical study protocols across databases with minimal effort. The initial mapping of the local code to the standard concepts of the CDM in each database requires detailed knowledge of the local data; however, once the local code is translated into a common representation, the detailed knowledge requirement is minimal. The observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) CDM has a comprehensive vocabulary and scheme, which are developed and maintained by the observational health data sciences and informatics (OHDSI) standardized vocabularies. The OHDSI research network based on OMOP CDM is capable of building multinational and large-scale observational data networks worldwide.",
        "To leverage this international data network for research on rare endocrine diseases, it is crucial to develop and validate a standardized set of digital phenotypes. Digital phenotypes refer to a set of clinical concepts and pseudocode representations of clinical practices. The effect of vocabulary mapping on fidelity and transportability in digital phenotypes has been rigorously validated across OMOP CDM databases for common diseases, including heart failure, diabetes mellitus, appendicitis, and cataracts. Despite the comprehensive nature of the OMOP vocabulary for rare diseases, as demonstrated by Zoch, et al., the influence of vocabulary mapping and the granularity of the original vocabulary on digital phenotyping for rare diseases has yet to be explored.",
        "In the present study, we developed and validated digital phenotypes for three rare endocrine diseases based on OMOP CDM: medullary thyroid cancer, nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. In addition, we evaluated the impact of granularity of vocabulary in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms (SNOMED CT), and Read vocabulary.",
        "Data were obtained from three databases: rare endocrine diseases (RED)\u2013CDM cohort from EHRs in Severance Hospital, one of the largest tertiary medical institutions in South Korea; IQVIA medical research database for UK general practitioners, known as the health improvement network (THIN); and IQVIA US hospital database for general hospitals. The EHR system at Severance Hospital was constructed using both ICD-10 and SNOMED CT vocabularies, which we subsequently utilized in our research.",
        "The healthcare systems of different countries usually have their own vocabulary for medical conditions. The US and Korea implement country-specific ICD-10 vocabularies: ICD-10-CM (US) and KCD7 (Korea), respectively. The UK has developed and maintained Read codes for the national health system. In the OMOP CDM, the diverse original vocabularies for medical conditions are mapped into the OMOP standard vocabulary based on SNOMED CT.",
        "We extracted the entire patient cohort from the Severance Hospital data if they had at least one diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer, hypoparathyroidism, or pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. A through manual review was then conducted to evaluate the actual disease status. Following this, patients who were classified as part of the disease group according to each digital phenotyping were identified.",
        "To estimate the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV), three specialists (Namki Hong, Kyoung Jin Kim, and Seunghyun Lee) reviewed the EHR data and confirmed the diagnosis. In case of disagreement, an expert with more than 10 years of experience (Yumie Rhee) made the final decision. PPV was calculated as the proportion of patients with diseases confirmed by physicians among those detected using the digital phenotyping. Sensitivity was calculated as the proportion of patients with positive results based on the digital phenotype among those with an actual disease in the RED\u2013CDM.",
        "The digital phenotyping performance was confirmed by applying it to the RED\u2013CDM cohort from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020 at Severance Hospital. Digital phenotyping based on ICD-10 and reported in prior literature was defined as ICD-10-originated OMOP concepts-level 1 (ICD-10-1). If the PPV and sensitivity in ICD-10-1 did not reach at least 80%, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for each digital phenotyping were updated under discussion among experts, and this was defined as ICD-10-originated OMOP concepts-level 2 (ICD-10-2). In each disease, digital phenotyping was revised for the following reasons.",
        "Experts\u2019 manual review suggested that the low sensitivity of ICD-10-1 in medullary thyroid cancer may be attributed to the exclusion criteria of a history of thyroglobulin test. Thyroglobulin test is a tumor marker to evaluate the therapeutic effect and monitor recurrence in patients with papillary and follicular thyroid cancer; this test is generally performed in patients with thyroid cancer. In the RED\u2013CDM cohort, 120 patients with medullary thyroid cancer who underwent thyroglobulin testing after surgery were observed. Therefore, in phenotyping based on ICD-10-2, the exclusion condition of a history of thyroglobulin test was deleted.",
        "The PPV of ICD-10-1 was lower than expected compared to the PPV of 91% reported in previous studies. Due to the nature of CDM, confirming whether surgery was performed at another hospital, along with diagnosis and laboratory test codes was challenging. Most cases of surgical hypoparathyroidism that occurred after thyroid surgery at other hospitals were erroneously classified as nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism at our institution. To correct this misclassification, we excluded patients who were taking levothyroxine.",
        "The low PPV of ICD-10-1 was attributed to issues with the definition of catecholamine measurement\u2014a total of two or more catecholamine tests, including one or more tests before surgery. Until the 2023 guideline update, adrenal incidentalomas were monitored annually with hormonal assessments, including catecholamine measurements, for a period of 4 to 5 years. Surgical intervention was indicated if an increase in size or abnormal adrenal function was detected during the follow-up. Consequently, under the ICD-10-1 definition, not only patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma but also those who underwent surgery after more than 2 years of hormonal follow-up testing, despite not having pheochromocytoma, were erroneously classified as part of the disease group. Therefore, for phenotyping based on ICD-10-2, the inclusion criteria of catecholamine measurements were revised to require at least one catecholamine test before surgery and more than one catecholamine test after surgery. Meanwhile, neuroblastoma arises from primitive sympathetic ganglion cells and can secrete catecholamines; in some cases, neuroblastoma is indistinguishable from pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma based on preoperative clinical features alone. Therefore, a history of being diagnosed with neuroblastoma at least once during the study period was added to the exclusion criteria.",
        "In addition, when the SNOMED CT code was applied instead of the ICD-10 code as a cohort entry condition in the ICD-10-2 definition, it was defined as SNOMED CT-originated OMOP concepts (Fig. 1). The difference between each entry condition code in the ICD-10 and SNOMED CT used in digital phenotyping is described in Supplementary Table 1(only online). For example, in medullary thyroid cancer, ICD used the entry condition code of the primary malignancy of the thyroid gland (ICD-10: C73, concept code: 94098005), whereas SNOMED CT used a more detailed entry condition code for medullary thyroid carcinoma (concept code: 255032005). Based on this digital phenotyping, the number of patients at Severance Hospital and IQVIA (US and UK) was investigated (Table 1, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, only online).",
        "The crude incidence rate was estimated using the total number of events divided by the total follow-up period duration for all patients. The incidence per 100000 person-years was calculated as the total number of events divided by the total number of person-years. Age was classified into nine age ranges: 0\u20139, 10\u201319, 20\u201329, 30-39, 40\u201349, 50\u201359, 60\u201369, 70\u201379, and 80\u201389 years. Patients older than 90 years were not included. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The study protocol and analysis codes are available in the reference provided.",
        "Each digital phenotyping was defined as described in Supplementary Fig. 2 (only online). The actual number of patients in the RED-CDM database for medullary thyroid cancer, nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma were 130, 116, and 172, respectively. For medullary thyroid cancer, only 17 patients were identified using ICD-10-1 during the study period. The PPV and sensitivity of phenotyping using ICD-10-1 were 100% and 13%, respectively. Using ICD-10-2, the sensitivity increased from 13% to 100%, whereas PPV decreased to 96%. When using the SNOMED CT-originated OMOP concept, the sensitivity and PPV were 97% and 100%, respectively.",
        "In nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism, the PPV of phenotyping based on ICD-10-1 was 72% and the sensitivity was 100%. After applying ICD-10-2, the PPV of ICD-10-2 phenotyping increased from 72% to 82%. When using SNOMED CT-originated OMOP concepts, the PPV improved from 82% to 84%.",
        "In pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, the PPV of ICD-10-1 was 58%, and the sensitivity was 90%. After applying ICD-10-2, the PPV increased from 58% to 62%. Moreover, in SNOMED CT-originated OMOP concepts, the PPV improved from 62% to 89% (Table 2).",
        "We applied this digital phenotyping to IQVIA (US and UK) database. Detailed incidence of each disease is described in Supplementary Table 2 (only online).",
        "In the RED\u2013CDM for South Korea, the incidence rates per 100000 person-years defined by phenotyping based on ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT were 0.09, 0.65, and 0.64, respectively. The crude incidence rates in South Korea for ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 0.38, 2.69, and 2.66, respectively. In the US cohort, the incidence rates per 100000 person-years of ICD-10-1 and ICD-10-2 phenotype were 0.06 and 0.08, respectively. The crude incidence rates in the US for ICD-10-1 and ICD-10-2 phenotype were 0.015 and 0.19, respectively. Meanwhile, the incidence using the SNOMED CT-originated OMOP concept in the US was 0. In the UK cohort, the incidence was confirmed as a zero count for all digital phenotyping.",
        "The incidence rates per 100000 person-years in the RED\u2013CDM for South Korea defined by phenotyping based on ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT were 0.77, 0.56, and 0.50, respectively. The crude incidence rates per 100000 persons of ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 3.19, 2.31, and 2.06, respectively. In the US cohort, the incidence rates per 100000 person-years for ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 0.76, 0.42, and 0.31, respectively. The crude incidence rates per 100000 persons in the US for ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 1.88, 1.04, and 0.77, respectively. In the UK cohort, the incidence rates per 100000 person-years for ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 0.07, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively. The crude incidence rates per 100000 persons in the UK for ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 1.28, 0.74, and 0.70, respectively.",
        "In the RED\u2013CDM cohort of South Korea, the incidence rates per 100000 person-years for ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 1.45, 1.28, and 0.87, respectively. The crude incidence rates of ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 6.00, 5.31, and 3.63, respectively. In the US cohort, the incidence rate per 100000 person-years of ICD-10-1 phenotype was 0.42, and that of ICD-10-2 phenotype was 0.23. The crude incidence rate in the US for ICD-10-1 phenotype was 1.04, and that of ICD-10-2 phenotype was 0.57. The incidence using the SNOMED CT OMOP concept in the US was 0. In the UK cohort, the incidence rates per 100000 person-years for phenotyping based on ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT were 0.02, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively. The crude incidence rates in the UK for ICD-10-1, ICD-10-2, and SNOMED CT phenotype were 0.33, 0.17, and 0.17, respectively (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 3, only online).",
        "In the UK, zero counts were obtained from the thyroid cancer entry code (ICD-10 code C73) in the ICD-10-based definition of medullary thyroid cancer (Supplementary Table 3, only online). Failure in detection of the diagnostic codes was likely. Also, no SNOMED CT mapping was identified in the US corresponding to medullary thyroid cancer or pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.",
        "In this study, the digital phenotyping was developed for three rare endocrine diseases: medullary thyroid cancer, nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. The performance of digital phenotyping was investigated and indicated that using SNOMED CT with high vocabulary granularity can be helpful regarding rare endocrine diseases. We also proposed ICD-10-originated concepts of three diseases, referred to as ICD-10-2, which demonstrated comparable sensitivity and PPV to SNOMED CT-originated OMOP concepts.",
        "The main finding of our study, that adopting SNOMED CT in routine clinical practice provides improved granularity in rare endocrine diseases, is consistent with previous literature. Several studies have compared the coverage between different vocabularies. For each concept, including diagnoses, treatments, and procedures, SNOMED CT showed greater coverage compared to ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM. In addition, studies conducted on rare diseases indicated that SNOMED CT could support research and evidence-based care due to its improved coverage. A study of 6519 rare diseases using the Unified Medical Language System showed that 11% of disorders matched ICD-9-CM, 21% matched ICD-10, and 44% matched SNOMED CT. Furthermore, ICD-10 coding for rare diseases is insufficient; only 300 of 6000\u20138000 diseases can be documented using ICD-10. A previous study using the Danish national registry also demonstrated that the detailed granularity of SNOMED CT aids in the identification of pheochromocytoma better than ICD-8 or ICD-10.",
        "However, compared to previous studies, our study had some limitations due to the lack of epidemiological data, with only one study reporting age-standardized incidence rates and no study reporting crude incidence rates (Supplementary Table 4, only online). This study revealed a certain tendency when compared with previous research; in South Korea, the incidence using phenotyping based on ICD-10-1 differed from that reported in previous nationwide cohort studies. In contrast, ICD-10-2 and SNOMED CT phenotyping showed similar or higher incidence rates to those previously reported. Considering that the RED\u2013CDM uses data from tertiary referral centers, a higher incidence rate in the RED-CDM cohort than those reported in previous studies is reasonable. In particular, the incidence rates of phenotyping based on ICD-10-1 and ICD-10-2 were higher than those reported at the Mayo Clinic in the US, using RED\u2013CDM, whereas the incidence rate of phenotyping based on SNOMED CT was similar to that reported at the Mayo Clinic. This finding suggests that SNOMED CT could provide accurate results. Also, the incidence in this study was similar to that reported in the US and lower than that reported in the UK. The difference between the incidence rates reported in previous literature from the UK and our study may be related to the fact that the UK database mainly includes primary care, whereas previous studies were based on the hospital setting. In both the US and UK, zero counts were observed for certain rare endocrine diseases due to a mismatch of diagnostic codes in our study. The reason for the zero count results of SNOMED CT-based digital phenotyping in the US data may be due to the insufficient granularity of the diagnostic inputs. In the UK THIN database, the reason for the absence of all digital phenotyping of medullary thyroid cancer is unclear; however, it may be influenced by mismatched or unmatched diagnostic codes. This finding is consistent with previous literature on UK Biobank codes, which demonstrated that only 2.7% of Read codes successfully mapped to ICD-10-codes. These results highlight the challenges of conducting international epidemiological studies using standardized coding systems like ICD-10, especially for rare disease, as they may present obstacles to consistent implementation across diverse settings.",
        "While the OMOP CDM provides a comprehensive ontology system to harmonize international data semantically, there are limitations in that most data sources are routinely collected; and the analysis is the secondary use of those data. As previously shown by Ostropolets, et al., heterogeneity in the granularity level across data sources can affect the performance of digital phenotyping.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present and validate digital phenotypes of rare endocrine diseases in multinational databases. This study may serve as a reference for future researchers who wish to undertake similar data mapping projects. In addition, our study suggests that the global monitoring of rare diseases is possible through CDM. Moreover, we demonstrated the strength of adopting SNOMED CT in routine clinical practice for monitoring rare endocrine diseases. These findings have important implications for global health policy regarding rare disease management. Policymakers should consider mandating or incentivizing the adoption of granular terminologies like SNOMED CT in healthcare systems to enable more effective monitoring and research of rare diseases. Such policies could facilitate the development of international collaborations and data sharing initiatives, ultimately leading to improved understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases worldwide.",
        "A limitation of this study is that we did not investigate vocabularies other than ICD-10, SNOMED CT, and Read codes. Phenotyping for another rare disease may be more accurate when using terminology from other specialty fields, including the NCI Thesaurus for cancer description and RadLex for radiological text. Moreover, the superior granularity of SNOMED CT compared to ICD-10 definitions is particularly evident in one of the three diseases in our study; however, when classifying the presence of diseases based solely on diagnostic codes, without using digital phenotyping with operational definitions, SNOMED CT demonstrated greater accuracy compared to ICD-10 (data not shown). Also, comparing the incidence rates of this rare endocrine diseases across different countries has been challenging due to the lack of reported data. Future research should expand the scope of this study to include a broader range of rare diseases, leveraging specialty-specific terminologies and data to enhance phenotype accuracy by integrating genomic, imaging, and text data. Additionally, future studies should aim to include a larger number of data sources from diverse healthcare settings and geographic regions to further validate the generalizability of the digital phenotypes and assess the impact of different data capturing systems and coding practices on phenotype performance.",
        "In summary, our study developed the digital phenotyping of three rare endocrine diseases, which may prove useful in future studies related to rare endocrine diseases. Furthermore, we showed that rare endocrine diseases can benefit from using SNOMED CT with a high vocabulary granularity. We also demonstrated that by applying various concepts, ICD-10 digital phenotyping can achieve performance comparable to SNOMED CT, making it applicable even in cases where ICD-10 is required.",
        "Since this was a distributed data analysis, individual patient-level data from each database cannot be shared owing to database governance restrictions. The prespecified protocol and executable source code are available online (https://github.com/redcdm/REDCDM_RedCohort)."
