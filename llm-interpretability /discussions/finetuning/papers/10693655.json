        "Natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly used to process unstructured/free-text patient-reported outcome (PRO) data available in electronic health records (EHRs). This systematic review summarizes the literature reporting NLP/ML systems/toolkits for analyzing PROs in clinical narratives of EHRs and discusses the future directions for the application of this modality in clinical care.",
        "We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies written in English between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2020. Seventy-nine studies meeting the eligibility criteria were included. We abstracted and summarized information related to the study purpose, patient population, type/source/amount of unstructured PRO data, linguistic features, and NLP systems/toolkits for processing unstructured PROs in EHRs.",
        "Most of the studies used NLP/ML techniques to extract PROs from clinical narratives (n=74) and mapped the extracted PROs into specific PRO domains for phenotyping or clustering purposes (n=26). Some studies used NLP/ML to process PROs for predicting disease progression or onset of adverse events (n=22) or developing/validating NLP/ML pipelines for analyzing unstructured PROs (n=19). Studies used different linguistic features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, and contextual features, to process unstructured PROs. Among the 26 NLP systems/toolkits we identified, 14 used rule-based NLP, 8 used hybrid NLP, and 4 used ML algorithms embedded in NLP.",
        "This study supports the potential utility of different NLP/ML techniques in processing unstructured PROs available in EHRs for clinical care. Though using annotation rules for NLP/ML to analyze unstructured PROs is dominant, deploying novel neural ML-based methods is warranted.",
        "Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide information about a patient\u2019s physical, psychological, somatic symptoms, daily functional status, health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL), and satisfaction with healthcare services that facilitate clinical decision-making and outcome evaluation. PROs are conventionally assessed through validated questionnaires or semi-structured interviews. However, these methods may not capture the full patient experience as their responses are bound by predetermined items. Additionally, it is challenging to collect PRO data from patients during time-limited clinical encounters. Therefore, finding effective approaches to assess, retrieve, and extract already available, unstructured PRO data from alternative sources, e.g., medical notes in electronic health records (EHRs), is important.",
        "PRO data in EHRs are often stored in an unstructured and free-text format (e.g., symptom narratives in a physician note) and cannot be directly used in clinical tasks (e.g., disease prediction, classification). Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) can turn unstructured PROs into a quantitative or structured format for clinical use. The application of NLP/ML techniques in clinical settings includes text pre-processing (e.g., tokenization, lemmatization, or stemming from the corpus), linguistic feature extraction for clinical narratives (e.g., encoding, affirmed/negated expressions), and clinical applications. Given the significant expansion of EHR ecosystems and the development of novel NLP/ML techniques over the past decade, the interest in processing unstructured PROs from clinical narratives through automatic or semi-automatic NLP/ML pipelines of free-text-based PROs is emerging.",
        "Previous reviews have described the application of NLP/ML methods for automatic extraction of non-PRO clinical narratives (e.g., disease progression, adverse drug reactions, medications, and treatments) from EHRs, yet review studies of NLP/ML techniques on unstructured PROs are limited. One review article investigated text-mining NLP techniques to extract symptom information through patient-authored data collected from social media (e.g., Twitter, WebMD, and Reddit). Another review article collected the applications of NLP in analyzing symptom-only data documented in EHRs. However, these studies mainly focus on the traditional rule-based NLP methods to process symptom data, followed by non-neural ML-based classifiers (e.g., support vector machine, logistic regression classifier), rather than novel neural network (e.g., CNN, RNN) or large language models (e.g., GPT, BERT) to analyze associations of PROs and clinical outcomes.",
        "With the recent advances in NLP/ML techniques, this study aimed to summarize research applying NLP/ML for processing and analyzing unstructured PRO data collected in EHRs. Specifically, we evaluated studies that analyzed unstructured PROs for clinical care or research, the type of unstructured PRO data, and the uniqueness of NLP/ML systems/toolkits and techniques to process unstructured PROs. In contrast to previous review studies, the findings from this study will improve our clinical insights of using NLP/ML techniques to process EHR-based unstructured PROs in a broader category (including symptom, functioning, and quality-of-life), together with other clinical parameters for clinical application.",
        "We searched studies written in English between January 1st, 2000 and December 31st, 2020 through PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Following the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, we identified 690 studies from PubMed, 739 from Scopus, and 886 from Web of Science (Figure 1). The search strategies are reported in Supplementary Table S1.",
        "Among the 2,318 studies identified from these three databases, 979 non-duplicate studies were retained for the title and abstract screening. Studies were considered for inclusion if they 1) focused on unstructured PRO data in EHRs or medical notes, and 2) used NLP techniques or applications accompanied by ML algorithms to extract or process unstructured PRO data. Studies were excluded if they 1) did not apply NLP/ML techniques, 2) were non-empirical studies (e.g., case reports, commentary), 3) were non-EHR-based studies (e.g., patient-authored data collected from social media), 4) were survey-based studies containing quantitative PRO data, 5) were previous systematic review studies or E-pub ahead of print, and/or 6) focused on non-chronic disease topics (e.g., infectious disease/vaccination). Based on these criteria, the first author (JAS) and the senior author (ICH) independently reviewed the title and abstract of all 979 studies retrieved from the literature search and retained 151 studies. Subsequently, the same two authors reviewed the full\u2010text articles, resolved any discrepancies, and selected 79 studies for inclusion in this study (Figure 1).",
        "We implemented the following steps to collect data from the original articles: 1) the first author (JAS) manually extracted data from the 79 studies and documented information in a database, 2) the senior author (ICH) reviewed all of the extracted information in the database, 3) both co-authors met to confirm the extracted data through reviewing each of the original articles included in this study, and 4) the second author (XH) adjudicated the discrepancy raised by the first and senior authors, and reviewed information summarized in the tables for identifying any errors. For each selected study, the characteristics of the study sample, the objective of the study, the type/format, size, and unit of unstructured PRO data, specific PRO content, and NLP/ML systems/toolkits and linguistic features used to process PRO data were abstracted and reported.",
        "Supplementary Table S2 displays the characteristics of 79 studies selected for inclusion in this systematic review. These studies included various participant sample sizes, ranging from 22 to 267,855, and different disease diagnoses, including any type (n=24), chronic disease (n=17), mental illness (n=23), cancer (n=8), and others (n=6). The majority of studies (n=73) focused on adults, six on pediatrics, and one on both adult and pediatric patient populations. Most of the PRO narrative data were primarily obtained from inpatient or outpatient EHRs (n=75), while several studies relied on the open data repositories/resources (e.g., MIMIC-III; n=4) and the national database (e.g., Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database; n=1). Narrative data from both inpatient settings (e.g., admission notes, discharge summaries, nursing narratives, emergency department documents, intensive care unit reports; n=57) and outpatient settings (e.g., primary care documents, psychiatric evaluation notes; n=35) were generated by healthcare professionals. The number of PRO narrative documents/grammatical units for NLP/ML analysis ranged from 100 to 4.2 million. Approximately 85% of the studies were based on English-based EHRs (USA: 66%, UK: 15%, and Canada, Island, and Australia: 4%), 10% from Chinese-based EHRs (China: 7% and Taiwan: 3%), and 5% from EHRs with other languages (Danish: 3%, Swedish: 1%, and Egyptian Arabic: 1%).",
        "The structure of the free-text PRO documents included keywords/phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or the entire document/medical note. Different vocabulary systems representing standardized clinical terminologies or nomenclatures (e.g., SNOMED-CT (n=10), UMLS (n=17), LOINC (n=1), DSM (n=3), ICD-codes (n=26)) were used to extract the representation of unstructured PROs. Among 37 studies that used a rule-based NLP approach, 14 adopted an extant rule-based NLP system, and 21 created study-specific/custom rules to extract the representation of unstructured PROs. Additionally, 20 studies used clinical/medical dictionaries to incorporate the standard clinical terminologies (e.g., LOINC, UMLS, SNOMED-CT) or created custom or study-specific terms/concepts for extracting unstructured PROs.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the features of studies that used NLP/ML techniques to process unstructured PRO data. Most of the studies used NLP/ML algorithms to identify or extract unstructured PROs from clinical narratives (n=74 studies), map or classify extracted PRO information into specific PRO domains (n=16), phenotype unstructured PROs to capture specific PRO features (n=9), and classify co-occurrence of multiple PRO problems (e.g., symptom clustering; n=5). Some studies used NLP/ML techniques to analyze unstructured PRO to predict the risk of disease progression or adverse medical events (n=22), develop/validate NLP/ML pipelines for analyzing unstructured PROs (n=19), test associations with clinical outcomes (n=5), and stratify or group patients for delivering tailored healthcare services per distinct patterns of PRO problems (n=3).",
        "Supplementary Table S3 displays the domains of unstructured PROs documented in EHRs that were extracted by NLP/ML approaches. The most popular documented PRO domains were psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress; 57.0% of 79 studies), followed by general symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain, insomnia; 48.8%), metabolic/hormonal symptoms (e.g., obese, weight loss; 28.8%), and physical symptoms in the digestive/gastrointestinal (e.g., bloating, constipation, diarrhea; 42.5%), nervous (e.g., arousal, attention problem, dysarthria; 41.3%), respiratory (e.g., cough, sneezing, dyspnea; 37.5%), cardiovascular (e.g., cardiac problem, angina, swelling of arms and legs; 28.8%), and dermatologic (e.g., itching, edema, rashes; 20.0%) organ systems. Several PRO domains (e.g., symptoms in the head/neck, musculoskeletal, urinary, sexual/reproductive organ systems; physical and social functioning) were documented by <20% of the studies.",
        "Table 2 provides examples of linguistic feature types derived from unstructured PROs: 1) lexical, 2) syntactic, 3) semantic, and 4) contextual features. Lexical features address the word-level characteristics of clinical narratives primarily using n-grams (e.g., uni- and bi-grams) representing the concept of unstructured PROs. Syntactic features address the phrase, clause, sentences, and part-of-speech tagging. While syntactic features represent grammatical patterns (e.g., noun and adjective/adverb phrases), semantic features focus on the meaning of words and terms, typically defined in a custom dictionary, controlled medical terminology, or lexicon (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED-CT, UMLS). Representing the relevance of specific words to individual texts, as opposed to their prevalence in a corpus, is another method used to process semantic features and semantic keywords for clustering the symptoms. Contextual features address the relative or absolute characteristics of unstructured PROs by considering the linguistic components (i.e., words, phrases, and sentences) neighboring around words or phrases of interest rather than searching keywords of unstructured PROs. One study shows that subject terms (e.g., \u201cmother\u201d, \u201cpatient\u201d), negation terms (e.g., \u201cdoes not\u201d), hypothetical terms (e.g., \u201cif\u201d), temporal terms (e.g., \u201cpreviously\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d), and termination terms (e.g., \u201chowever\u201d) were examples of contextual analytic features. Another study labeled the contextual feature as \u201cif-clause\u201d for the text \u201cI recommended nitroglycerin if he should develop chest pain\u201d.",
        "Table 3 displays the NLP systems/toolkits used to process unstructured PROs in EHRs, inclusive of 15 generic (e.g., ConText, FMA, GATE, Hiedel Time, MALLET, NegEX, SUTime) and 11 clinical (e.g., MEDLEE, TextHunter, v3NLP, cTAKES, ClinREAD, Clamp, MetaMap, RedCap, V3NLP) systems/toolkits. Techniques utilized under each system/toolkit were mostly rule-based NLP (n=14 techniques), followed by hybrid NLP (n=8 techniques) and ML algorithms embedded in NLP (n=4 techniques). The rule-based approach uses rules created by experts to categorize or label unstructured PRO data, and some studies validated the rules with unstructured data from different patient samples and subsequently applied the rules to the new samples. ML-based approaches often train established classification algorithms with statistical inference techniques through previously annotated text-corpus. Once ML algorithms learn the unstructured data of a new system, they can be applied to other lexical, semantic, and contextual meanings without referring to any rules. In contrast, the hybrid approach adopts both rule- and ML-based methods, and integrates expert-generated, ruled-based systems to guide ML algorithms to perform the analysis. Fifteen NLP systems/toolkits were rule-based (e.g., generic toolkits: ConText, FMA, Heidel Time, NegEX, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, SUTime, and Wordnet; clinical toolkits: CliX NLP, ClinREAD, MedLEE, MedEx, NLP-PAC, and V3NLP). Specific ML-embedded systems/toolkits included MALLET and GENSIM with R, and hybrid systems/toolkits included GATE, UIMA, Clamp, cTAKES, MetaMap, and MedTagger. A full list of references is in Supplementary Table S4.",
        "Table 4 reports the 3-step NLP/ML methods to process unstructured PROs from EHR clinical narratives: Step 1 is data pre-processing (n=60 studies), Step 2 is feature extraction and representations (n=69 studies), and Step 3 is data analysis (n=61 studies, including 39 using non-neural NLP/ML methods and 22 using neural NLP/ML methods). The step-by-step process was also summarized in Figure 2. The most common techniques for data pre-processing were annotation and text tokenization. The most common techniques for feature extraction and representations were rule-based NLP, affirmation/negation, and word2vec/bag-of-words (BOW). Regarding NLP/ML analytic methods, the most common non-neural ML methods were Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree, and Conditional Random Field (CRF). In contrast, commonly used neural NLP/ML methods included Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN; e.g., LSTM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN or feed forward network). As an example of the way neural NLP/ML methods are used in clinical settings, the novel contextual embeddings of the BERT model use a context-based representation of chief complaints to predict specific signs/symptoms (e.g., pain, cognitive confusion) labeled by the experts and map semantically similar chief complaints to nearby points of vector space. A full list of references was provided in Supplementary Table S5.",
        "This systematic review study focuses on PRO-related studies and the findings have a significant contribution to the literature by summarizing the NLP/ML applications in PROs (e.g., classification, phenotyping, and clustering; PRO-based risk prediction and stratification for clinical outcomes), the available NLP systems or toolkits, and NLP/ML pipelines (e.g., preprocessing, feature extraction and representations, and data analysis using non-neural or neural ML methods). Among 79 selected studies, most studies (>90%) used NLP/ML techniques for extracting free-text PRO data, followed by predicting the risk of adverse events (30%), classifying, phenotyping or clustering PROs (20%), and testing associations between PROs and clinical outcomes (8%). Given the challenges of using standard surveys to assess PROs in busy clinics, as well as well-described barriers to PRO instrument application into routine clinical care, NLP/ML application provides a convenient mechanism to integrate PROs available in EHRs into clinical workflows for clinical decision-making.",
        "We found that different types/units of unstructured PROs (e.g., keyword/phrase, sentence, paragraph, entire document/note) were used in NLP/ML analyses. Vocabularies from standard clinical terminologies or nomenclatures (e.g., SNOMED-CT, UMLS, LOINC, DSM-5, and ICD-codes) were commonly used to process unstructured PROs. These rule-based systems (e.g., ontologies, medical terminologies) were typically used to identify the meaning of the words and terms from free-text PROs. Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine\u2013Clinical Terms (SNOMED\u2013CT) is deemed the most comprehensive computer collection of medical terms and medical relationships. The feasibility of mapping other medical terminologies (e.g., ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes) to the SNOMED\u2013CT makes the translation between different terminology systems feasible. To achieve semantic interoperability. many studies used medical vocabulary systems to map PRO words or terminologies. Additionally, to account for disease-specific content, some studies created dictionaries for incorporating existing clinical terminologies and/or added new terminologies to complement the functionality of extant rule-based or vocabulary systems. In the clinical setting, PRO data are often created by clinicians through handwriting or typing in an unstructured format and stored in EHRs, and then coders follow medical terminologies (e.g., ICD diagnosis code, SNOMED-CT, UMLS) or vocabulary systems to map or annotate the unstructured data into the structured format. Our review study details the implementation of different NLP/ML techniques for transforming unstructured PROs into vectorized structured formats, together with the ML techniques for clinical use (e.g., disease prediction).",
        "The studies included in our review used 15 generic and 11 clinical NLP systems/toolkits to process unstructured PRO data and transformed information into structured PROs. NLP systems/toolkits typically transfer unstructured PROs into numerically computable information through pre-processing free-text PRO and clinical data, extracting specific features of the data, and then data normalization (i.e., converting a token into its base form). The systems/toolkits for free-text PRO processing included rule-based NLP, ML-based, or hybrid approaches. Practically, NLP/ML techniques were commonly used for feature extractions and representation (n=70), and nearly half of these studies (n=37) relied on rule-based methods. However, the rule-based method is not efficient because it requires manual extraction of knowledge that may involve trial- and-error. Furthermore, the accuracy of the rule-based model depends on appropriate and available rules and domain expertise. Few studies included in our present review found comparable or superior performance of ML-based or hybrid approaches (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1) to that of the rule-based NLP approach. Technically, ML-based or hybrid approaches learn the patterns between phrases and sentences, which improves accuracy and generalizability in representing clinical narratives beyond rule-based approaches.",
        "Modern neural network-based ML algorithms (e.g., RNN, transformer-style model) are a breakthrough for processing unstructured clinical narratives. Several studies in our review reported better performance of newer neural network-based ML algorithms (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) compared to traditional NLP or other neural network-based ML algorithms (e.g., ELMO, LSTM). The superior performance of the BERT model to other NLP/ML methods is because the BERT model uses effective pre-training methods (i.e., masked language modeling and next sentence prediction) and deploys multiple transformer layers to account for contextual information of natural language. The BERT model has been shown to effectively capture linguistic features (i.e., syntactic, semantic, contextual features). In comparison, the traditional feature extraction and representation methods (e.g., bag-of-words, NER, n-gram) require domain knowledge to design complex feature engineering with less generalizability. As a result, the semantic features derived from the BERT model may incorporate more contextualized meanings of words than traditional NLP models when contexts of words vary. Recently, clinical BERT models (e.g., Bio-BERT, Cancer-BERT, and BlueBERT) have been developed, which continue fine-tune BERT models through the corpus of PubMed, MIMIC, or other clinical sources, to meet different purposes. These findings suggest the usefulness of domain-specific neural network-based ML methods for processing unstructured PROs in the future.",
        "While this review collects studies prior to 2021, we have covered the state-of-the-art NLP models (e.g., RNN, Bio-BERT, and Cancer-BERT) and those techniques have not been changed in PRO-related studies since 2020. The recent rise of deep learning approaches typically brings novel embedding techniques that can jointly integrate lexical, syntactic, semantic, and contextual patterns into unified vectors, which significantly reduces labor expenses and domain knowledge requirements of feature engineering and design. The core idea of developing embedding techniques is to use context to define language and therefore train embedding models (i.e., neural networks). Co-occurrence, word prediction, and neighboring sentence matching are useful approaches to obtain the embedding models for PRO research. Studies building deep learning models for PRO assessment benefit from the power and flexibility of embedding techniques to represent features from token to document levels. Those studies have demonstrated their success in embedding techniques to learn representative features of free-text data in PRO research, such as phenotype inference, information extraction, and diagnosis. Nevertheless, ML models trained on word embeddings output tables of weights can make debugging missed predictions more challenging compared to the models trained on simpler linguistic features.",
        "Though various NLP systems/toolkits used to analyze unstructured PROs from clinical narratives have been reported, the validity of using unstructured PROs derived from clinical narratives versus standard PRO surveys remains unclear. The standard PRO surveys may likely measure generic PRO concepts across all patients, whereas unstructured PROs from clinical narratives can capture patient-unique PROs that may not be included in the standard PRO surveys. Several studies in our review used PRO data collected from the survey to evaluate the validity of NLP/ML pipelines for unstructured PROs. Agreement of PRO data between data collected from self-reports and EHR-based unstructured PROs analyzed with NLP/ML ranged from a range of 67\u201382%. A similar finding (63\u201375% agreement) was found in the patient responses to standard surveys versus unstructured symptom data (e.g., chest pain, dyspnea, cough) documented in the physicians\u2019 medical notes. Several studies have noted the value of unstructured PROs as anchors in predicting or correlating various clinical outcomes (e.g., disease onset, suicidal ideation, readmission, mortality). These findings suggest that unstructured PROs may be a surrogate for the standard PRO surveys.",
        "The findings of this review study have important implications for future clinical research and care. Although NLP/ML techniques are evolving, successful NLP/ML application requires the implementation of integrated platforms that seamlessly interconnect EHR functionality and NLP/ML algorithms to facilitate clinical interpretation. Evidence shows that integrating unstructured PROs into EHRs likely improves cancer survivorship care by predicting late effects based on worsening symptoms and other clinical data. However, there is a critical need to find novel platforms/systems for integrating unstructured PROs into EHRs and using NLP/ML techniques to annotate unstructured PROs. Further effort is warranted to create meaningful PRO scores from free-text narratives based on the features derived from NLP/ML to be comparably interpretable to scores from standard PRO surveys.",
        "There are implementation barriers to collecting and integrating unstructured PROs from EHRs for NLP/ML applications. The major barriers include technical complexity, system interoperability, and concerns about the quality of unstructured clinical narratives (e.g., fragmented or incomplete words or sentences to represent a patient\u2019s health status or symptoms) in EHRs. Adopting the Common Data Model or Common Data Warehouse to enhance model portability may improve the collection of standard and high-quality unstructured PRO data from clinical narratives. Instead of relying on text-based PRO data, alternative methods include the use of speech or voice recognition systems for collecting unstructured PROs and developing audio-based NLP/ML pipelines to automatically analyze PRO information from patient-doctor conversations in clinics. There are different ways to manage conversation-based PROs: 1) using NLP/ML algorithms to automatically annotate and analyze the conversation-based PROs and 2) using software to transcribe voice data, followed by NLP/ML to annotate and analyze the transcribed data. If systems were set up appropriately, acoustic recordings of clinical interactions would involve less paperwork and be less prone to data collection artifacts. However, compared to text, audio contains richer information (e.g., prosody) that humans process together with lexical meaning to alter language\u2019s propositional content. For example, an ironic phrasing of \u201cyeah, that medication worked\u201d captured in audio would be interpreted as a declaration of efficacy if it were simply converted into text. Once the voice-based PRO data are annotated, the NLP/ML pipelines could be applied for data analysis and clinical application. Few-shot learning, or prompting, could also be used to improve parts of PRO prediction by significantly augmenting the amount of relevant ground truth training data.",
        "This review study contains some limitations. First, several selected studies did not report specific information to meet our inclusion criteria (e.g., frequently used linguistic features); therefore, the results may not fully reflect the status of NLP/ML applications in unstructured PROs. Second, we did not evaluate the quality of the selected studies because the standards or guidelines for evaluating NLP/ML applications in unstructured PROs have yet been established. Finally, we included studies that were published by the end of 2020, while NLP/ML techniques evolve day by day. However, to our best knowledge, our study has covered the latest trends and techniques of applying NLP/ML techniques (e.g., BERT) for researching unstructured PROs. We are aware of large generative language models (e.g., ChatGPT), however, those newer generative AI techniques have not been applied in recent PRO-related studies.",
        "While the NLP revolution, specifically generative AI, has taken place in the past 2\u20133 years, our literature search until 2023 found no instances of generative AI being applied to unstructured PROs. Large language models become the promising direction for future PROs studies, and contemporary NLP techniques (e.g., BERT or GPT) discussed in this review study can provide a solid background for future PROs research. One notable example of generative AI is ChatGPT (e.g., GPT-4 developed by OpenAI) which aims to generate a patient summary using information provided by clinicians or patients and to facilitate interactive text-based communication with users. It is important to note that although ChatGPT can address potential bias in the training data, it has not undergone a comprehensive fine-tuning and validation process for PROs and other medical data. Moreover, its integration into EHRs for annotating and analyzing vast amounts of unstructured PROs in medical notes remains uncertain. Currently, ChatGPT is valuable for providing a PRO summary based on the data provided by clinicians or patients, but it should not be relied upon for clinical interpretation or decision-making until empirical studies establish its validity. We believe the methods and resources of traditional NLP/ML reported in this review will be valuable to inform the generative NLP approaches (e.g., GPT) of how to incorporate domain knowledge and promote evidence-based PRO inferences from unstructured medical data. Our present recommendation is to employ established, validated NLP/ML approaches for feature extraction, including rule-based or neural machine/deep learning algorithms, and utilize NLP systems/toolkits for the analysis of unstructured PROs within EHRs.",
        "This systematic review study reports the usefulness of NLP/ML techniques in processing unstructured PRO data. Currently, using the established rules to annotate unstructured PROs through NLP/ML systems/toolkits is the dominant method, though the use of novel neural ML-based methods is increasing. Transformer NLP/ML models (e.g., BERT) are the most cutting-edge and dominating techniques to process unstructured PROs in EHRs. Although we did not come across any studies utilizing generative large language models like ChatGPT for extracting and analyzing unstructured PROs and integrated into EHRs, the rapid advancements in generative AI offer a potential opportunity for future exploration and evaluation in this area."
