        "The application of chatbots and NLP in radiology is an emerging field, currently characterized by a growing body of research. An umbrella review has been proposed utilizing a standardized checklist and quality control procedure for including scientific papers. This review explores the early developments and potential future impact of these technologies in radiology. The current literature, comprising 15 systematic reviews, highlights potentialities, opportunities, areas needing improvements, and recommendations. This umbrella review offers a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of natural language processing (NLP) and natural language models (NLMs), including chatbots, in healthcare. These technologies show potential for improving clinical decision-making, patient engagement, and communication across various medical fields. However, significant challenges remain, particularly the lack of standardized protocols, which raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of these tools in different clinical contexts. Without uniform guidelines, variability in outcomes may hinder the broader adoption of NLP/NLM technologies by healthcare providers. Moreover, the limited research on how these technologies intersect with medical devices (MDs) is a notable gap in the literature. Future research must address these challenges to fully realize the potential of NLP/NLM applications in healthcare. Key future research directions include the development of standardized protocols to ensure the consistent and safe deployment of NLP/NLM tools, particularly in high-stake areas like radiology. Investigating the integration of these technologies with MD workflows will be crucial to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care.

Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term impact of these technologies on patient outcomes, while interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare professionals, data scientists, and ethicists is essential for driving innovation in an ethically sound manner. Addressing these areas will advance the application of NLP/NLM technologies and improve patient care in this emerging field.",
        "Traditional radiology, which relied on film-based imaging and manual interpretation, was the standard for many decades. The process was often labor-intensive, requiring physical handling of films and a slower pace of analysis. Radiologists would examine these films under specific lighting conditions, with limited ability to quickly share or store images for collaborative analysis. While it was a significant step forward in medical imaging, traditional radiology had its limitations, including issues with image quality, difficulty in sharing results, and challenges in maintaining consistent standards across different institutions. However, the transition to digital radiology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries dramatically changed this landscape.",
        "Radiology has evolved significantly due to standardization processes over the past millennium. The introduction of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) and the integration of Radiology Information Systems (RISs) with Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACSs) were key milestones. Initially, these advances focused on traditional radiology modalities like X-rays and CT scans. Over time, they expanded to include a wide range of diagnostic imaging techniques.",
        "DICOM and RISs have improved the consistency and interoperability of imaging systems, enabling better integration across modalities. This includes both ionizing radiation methods (X-rays) and non-ionizing techniques (ultrasound, MRI). While \u201cdigital radiology\u201d is sometimes used broadly, it typically refers to DICOM-compliant digital technologies in radiology.",
        "On the other hand, integrating tissue and cellular imaging with digital health systems has been slower. Digital pathology, covering histology and cytology, adopted digital technologies more gradually, partly due to the delayed introduction of DICOM standards for Whole-Slide Imaging (WSI). Unlike diagnostic imaging, DICOM standards for WSI were released later, slowing integration.",
        "The rapid adoption of digital radiology has paved the way for the introduction of AI in radiology. Building on these advancements, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into radiology has become a natural next step in this evolution. As digital systems provided the infrastructure for handling large volumes of imaging data, AI technologies began to emerge, capable of analyzing these datasets more rapidly and with greater accuracy than human radiologists alone. AI\u2019s ability to detect patterns, assist in diagnostics, and even predict future medical conditions holds tremendous promise, ushering in a new era of medical imaging. The combination of digital imaging and AI is expected to further revolutionize radiology, improving both patient outcomes and workflow efficiency, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation in diagnostic imaging. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, AI research in radiology has surged, with numerous publications appearing post-2020. A simple PubMed search shows a significant increase in AI-related research in radiology. For more details, see the growing publications on AI and radiology after 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology due to the urgent need for predictive diagnostics, particularly in medical imaging. This urgency spurred unprecedented collaboration among diverse disciplines, including radiology, medical physics, imaging science, computer science, and informatics, to develop innovative AI solutions. The rapid convergence of these fields revealed challenges stemming from education and career transitions between domains, such as adapting AI for non-imaging data to imaging data, transitioning from clinical imaging roles to AI-focused research, and applying general AI methods to COVID-19-specific imaging. Lessons learned from these transitions highlight the need to address discipline-specific complexities to improve the integration and effectiveness of AI. Today, AI applications in radiology extend well beyond emergency responses, transforming the field through innovations like automated detection systems for breast cancer in mammography, segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans, and enhanced analysis of liver fibrosis in ultrasound imaging. AI-powered algorithms are also streamlining workflows, improving reporting efficiency, and reducing diagnostic errors. Furthermore, predictive models are being employed to assess disease progression, assist in treatment planning, and enable precision medicine approaches. These developments illustrate AI\u2019s growing impact on radiology, not only as a tool for addressing specific imaging challenges but also as a catalyst for advancing personalized and efficient healthcare delivery.",
        "AI\u2019s enhanced capabilities are expected to revolutionize diagnostic imaging by improving accuracy, efficiency, and predictive analytics, offering new opportunities for innovation and patient care. These advancements in AI highlight its potential to elevate radiology\u2019s effectiveness in diagnosing complex conditions and streamlining workflows.",
        "Building on this progress, another pivotal transformation in healthcare involves the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and AI-based chatbots. While diagnostic AI primarily focuses on image analysis and predictive modeling, LLMs and AI chatbots aim to improve how healthcare professionals and patients interact with medical information. These tools, grounded in natural language processing, enable efficient data synthesis, report generation, and conversational interfaces, bridging the gap between data-driven diagnostics and user-centric communication solutions.",
        "This complementary evolution of AI technologies reflects a broader trend toward integrating innovative tools across healthcare domains, enhancing both clinical decision-making and patient engagement.",
        "Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI algorithms trained on large text corpora, which enables them to understand and generate coherent, contextually relevant language. This capability allows LLMs to handle complex tasks, such as content analysis, report generation, and synthesizing diverse information. They are particularly useful for medical applications, where they can assist in generating comprehensive imaging reports and processing intricate medical data. LLMs are designed to process a wide range of topics with deep language comprehension, making them effective for diverse uses in healthcare.",
        "In contrast, AI-based chatbots are systems designed to interact with users through natural language. They assist with a variety of tasks, such as answering patient questions, appointment scheduling, and managing administrative functions, typically following predefined scripts or interactions. While both LLMs and chatbots leverage AI to process and generate text, chatbots are primarily optimized for interactive, structured conversations with users. They differ from LLMs in that they are specialized for specific, task-oriented communications rather than broad content generation.",
        "The key distinction between these two technologies is crucial for their application in healthcare. LLMs excel at understanding and generating complex information across multiple domains, which allows them to support detailed reporting and medical documentation. Chatbots, however, are designed to facilitate real-time, interactive communication, helping to streamline tasks such as patient triage or answering frequently asked questions in radiology settings. These technologies can complement one another in enhancing both administrative workflows and clinical decision-making in healthcare environments.",

        "COVID-19 Applications (2020\u20132021): During the pandemic, chatbots supported triage and managed the influx of imaging requests. They facilitated remote consultations and helped explain imaging findings to patients, playing a crucial role in maintaining healthcare access.",
        "LLM-Enhanced Systems (post-2021): The integration of large language models (LLMs) has enabled chatbots to provide sophisticated support in interpreting imaging data, suggesting differential diagnoses, and even assisting in educational initiatives for radiologists and trainees.",
        "Key milestones in their evolution include the following:",
        "With technological advancements, \u201cchatbot\u201d is now the predominant term.",
        "Models like ChatGPT, based on LLMs, have appeared in PubMed since 2022, with a marked increase in publications from 2022. The entry of ChatGPT into PubMed, particularly in radiology, became noticeable from 2023 onward.",
        " The following is as observed: ",
        "The integration of large language models (LLMs) and AI-based chatbots into radiology has been a transformative process. Initially, chatbots in healthcare including radiology were used primarily for administrative tasks such as appointment scheduling and answering basic patient queries. However, as AI technologies evolved, so did the role of chatbots in radiology. They began supporting radiologists in clinical workflows by optimizing administrative processes and streamlining communication, which in turn allowed radiologists to focus more on diagnostic tasks.",
        "LLMs, which specialize in complex language tasks, and AI-based chatbots, which excel in interactive, context-specific communication, are now significantly shaping the field. Chatbots have advanced to assist with clinical decision-making, interpreting imaging protocols, and even aiding in the diagnostic process. Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these systems played a pivotal role in managing radiological workflows, offering triage support, and facilitating remote consultations.",
        "The adoption of these technologies in radiology has followed a clear progression. From simple virtual assistants to sophisticated AI models, chatbots are now integrated into diagnostic and educational practices. LLMs, in particular, have enabled chatbots to provide more advanced support, offering differential diagnoses and assisting in radiologist training. This transition has been fueled by the growing need for accuracy, efficiency, and predictive analytics in medical imaging.",
        " In light of this, the following is observed: ",

        "The field of natural language processing (NLP), including chatbot applications, in radiology has witnessed remarkable progress, starting with foundational reviews and culminating in real-world applications that promise to transform clinical workflows. A critical turning point occurred in 2016, when Pons et al. published the first comprehensive systematic review of NLP in radiology, which provided a solid foundation for future developments. This review was pivotal in highlighting the potential of NLP technologies to extract structured data from the vast amounts of unstructured, free-text radiology reports stored in electronic health records. The 2016 study by Pons et al. examined 67 publications on NLP in radiology, focusing on methods to automatically extract meaningful data from radiology reports. The study emphasized both the promise of NLP to improve clinical decision-making, enhance research, and streamline workflows, as well as the challenges associated with its implementation. These challenges included issues of accuracy, adaptability to various reporting formats, and the need for standardization in NLP methods. Despite these hurdles, the review set the stage for the growing interest in NLP in the years to follow, signaling its transformative potential in radiology. Following Pons et al.\u2019s groundwork, researchers began exploring the application of NLP in broader aspects of radiology. From 2017 to 2019, the body of the literature on NLP grew substantially, with studies focusing on improving information extraction and leveraging deep learning techniques for more complex analysis. During this period, Blackley et al. conducted another systematic review, this time exploring speech recognition (SR) technology in clinical documentation, which included radiology. Their review demonstrated that while speech recognition was advancing, challenges around accuracy and integration into clinical systems remained significant. By 2020, NLP in radiology began to shift towards more advanced techniques, particularly deep learning models. For instance, Sorin et al. applied deep learning-based NLP models to analyze radiology reports for specific conditions, such as pulmonary embolism. The increasing sophistication of neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) marked a leap in the ability to analyze medical data more efficiently and accurately. This era marked the start of more complex NLP applications, with a shift from rule-based methods to data-driven, machine learning models that were capable of learning from vast datasets and improving over time. As NLP technologies in radiology became more advanced, the importance of standardization and external validation came to the forefront. In 2021, Davidson et al. published a systematic review that identified key gaps in the NLP research landscape, particularly around the lack of standardized reporting and the need for external validation of NLP models before they could be implemented in real-world clinical settings. This review underscored the variability in NLP model performance and highlighted the necessity of consistent protocols and metrics for evaluating NLP technologies across studies. In recent years, chatbots, as a subset of NLP applications, have also emerged in the clinical setting. These AI-driven systems have been explored for improving structured radiology reporting, offering assistance in interpreting and generating reports based on radiological data. Notable systematic reviews, such as those by Sacoransky et al., Keshavarz et al., and Temperley et al., have addressed the evolving role of chatbots in radiology, highlighting their potential for enhancing clinical workflows while also discussing performance limitations and challenges regarding integration into existing systems. In 2024, Klug et al. explored the potential of NLP tools across the patient journey, from admission to discharge, presenting a thorough systematic review that underscored how NLP can optimize patient management, especially in terms of documentation and discharge planning. Younis et al. conducted another comprehensive review on AI in healthcare, detailing its applications and challenges, including the use of NLP for data extraction and the broader context of its adoption in medicine. Their analysis suggests that while NLP can be a valuable tool in healthcare, it faces challenges related to data privacy, scalability, and ethical concerns. Furthermore, in 2024, a systematic review by Keshavarz et al. on ChatGPT in radiology emphasized its potential to aid in structured radiology reporting, particularly in generating initial draft reports, but also pointed out the model\u2019s limitations in dealing with complex cases. Similarly, in the same year, the study by Temperley et al. highlighted the growing role of ChatGPT in radiology, stressing its future potential to assist radiologists in report writing and the challenges that lie in the integration of such technologies into routine clinical practice. In the area of breast imaging, Diab et al. reviewed NLP applications for breast cancer detection, noting the improvements in diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency that NLP tools can bring, particularly for radiology reports. A similar the review by Saha et al. addressed the specific use of NLP for breast cancer, focusing on how structured data can be extracted from reports to improve diagnostic consistency and support clinical decision-making. Despite the rapid growth in NLP applications, challenges remain. The recent studies by Sacoransky et al. and Keshavarz et al. underscore the persistent issues of model reliability, data privacy concerns, and the need for validation in real-world clinical environments. These reviews indicate that while NLP, including chatbot applications, holds significant promise, a cautious approach is necessary when implementing these technologies in healthcare settings. From 2022 onward, the focus shifted to real-world deployment, ethical considerations, and overcoming systemic barriers. Recent studies have started emphasizing the importance of ensuring that NLP technologies are not only effective but also transparent, accountable, and ethical in their use. Issues such as patient data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and bias in training data have become central to the discourse on NLP in healthcare. Researchers and practitioners have increasingly called for interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the responsible deployment of NLP in clinical environments, with an emphasis on ethics and regulatory oversight. The journey from 2016 to the present has been marked by continuous progress, but challenges remain. The early systematic reviews, starting with Pons et al., set the stage for exploring the potential of NLP in radiology, revealing both the promise and the hurdles of these technologies. As the field continues to evolve, future research will likely focus on improving model accuracy, ensuring data privacy, and standardizing reporting practices to enable the broader adoption of NLP tools, including chatbots, in clinical settings. NLP, including chatbot applications, is expected to play an increasingly significant role in automating data extraction, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving workflow efficiency in radiology. However, for this vision to be fully realized, continued advancements in technology, collaboration across disciplines, and a commitment to ethical standards will be essential.",
