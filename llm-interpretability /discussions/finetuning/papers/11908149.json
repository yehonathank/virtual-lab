        "The hypothalamus and zona incerta of the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), a model organism important for translational neuroscience research, contain diverse neuronal populations essential for survival, but how these populations are structurally organized as systems remains elusive. With the advent of novel gene-editing technologies, there has been a growing need for high-spatial-resolution maps of rat hypothalamic neurochemical cell types to aid in their functional interrogation by virus-directed cell type-specific gene manipulation or to validate their expression in transgenic lines. Here, we present a draft report describing Chemopleth 1.0, a chemoarchitecture database for the rat hypothalamus (HY) and zona incerta (ZI), which will eventually feature downloadable interactive maps featuring the census distributions of five immunoreactive neurochemical systems: (1) vasopressin (as detected using its gene co-product, copeptin); (2) neuronal nitric oxide synthase (EC 1.14.13.39); (3) hypocretin 1/orexin A; (4) melanin-concentrating hormone; and (5) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. These maps are formatted for the widely used Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) open-access rat brain atlas. Importantly, this dataset retains atlas stereotaxic coordinates that facilitate the precise targeting of the cell bodies and/or axonal fibers of these neurochemical systems, thereby potentially serving to streamline delivery of viral vectors for gene-directed manipulations. The maps will be presented together with novel open-access tools to visualize the data, including a new Python programming language-based workflow to quantify cell positions and fiber densities for BM4.0. The workflow produces \u201cheat maps\u201d of neurochemical distributions from multiple subjects: 1) isopleth maps that represent consensus distributions independent of underlying atlas boundary conditions, and 2) choropleth maps that provide distribution differences based on cytoarchitectonic boundaries. These multi-subject cartographic representations are produced in Python from exported atlas maps first generated in the Adobe\u00ae Illustrator\u00ae vector graphics environment, which are then reimported and placed directly into the Brain Maps atlas. The soon-to-be-released files can also be opened using the free vector graphics editor, Inkscape. We also introduce a refined grid-based coordinate system for this dataset, register it with previously published spatial data for the HY and ZI, and introduce FMRS (Frequencies Mapped with Reference to Stereotaxy), as a new adaptation of long-used ephemeris systems for grid-based annotation of experimental observations. This database, which includes all data described in greater detail in and, provides critical spatial targeting information for these neurochemical systems unavailable from mRNA-based maps and allows readers to place their own datasets in register with them. It also provides a space for the continued buildout of a community-driven atlas-based spatial model of rat hypothalamic chemoarchitecture, allowing experimental observations from multiple laboratories to be registered to a common spatial framework.",
        "In this initial draft report, we describe Chemopleth 1.0, a soon-to-be-released downloadable database of maps of medial and lateral hypothalamic and zona incerta cell populations. Two sets of scientific developments in the 1990s \u2013 one, a set of careful labeling experiments, and the other, a set of rigorous technical innovations \u2013 form the basis for this database, which provides novel spatial data for five neurochemical systems.",
        "First, experiments described over twenty-five years ago, reported the relationship between neuropeptide-expressing cell populations in the medial hypothalamus (e.g., \u03b1MSH) and those in the lateral hypothalamus (e.g., H1/OA, MCH). These seminal findings, which included mRNA-label cell body distributions and select photographs of cellular interactions between some of these populations, were a high-water mark for hypothalamic chemoarchitectural studies, providing critical evidence linking first-order leptin-sensitive neuronal populations to downstream, second-order communication nodes (Sawchenko, 1998).",
        "Second, the introduction by Swanson of digital atlas templates in the form of vector graphics files as a companion software package to his Brain Maps rat brain atlas, marked a quiet turning point for neuroscientists seeking to create electronically formatted maps of neuroanatomical data they obtained from their own experiments for this model organism (reviewed in). One of the groups cited above used the Brain Maps atlas templates to map the distributions of cell bodies for medial and lateral hypothalamic neuronal populations, and additional groups have provided cell body maps of these populations in more recent versions of the Brain Maps reference space.",
        "The Chemopleth 1.0 database extends these developments \u2013 identifying medial and lateral hypothalamic cell groups and mapping their distributions to the Brain Maps atlas \u2013 in several important ways to better facilitate the precise targeting of these systems and their anatomical registration with other data for contemporary usage. First, unlike previous maps, the immunoreactive protein (i.e., immunohistochemical) maps in this database chart not only the cell bodies but also the axons and, in some cases, the terminal fields specific to these neurochemical systems in a standardized format. This is important for those interested in delivering retrogradely transportable vectors into axonal terminal fields (e.g., retro-AAV tracers), the locations for which are not provided by mRNA-based maps. Second, the cell bodies and axons charted in our database are mapped with respect to stereotaxic space, coordinates for which should be valuable to any experimentalist seeking to have a basic starting point to target vectors in the rat brain. At the time of this writing, such stereotaxically guided information is lacking in 2-D models at the spatial resolutions mapped here, let alone 3-D models of rodent hypothalamus produced by light sheet microscopy. Third, we provide computational tools that permit analysis and visualization of spatial information for each system in more than one subject and in more than one graphical representation to showcase the extent of variability for the distribution patterns observed, and to identify for the community the denser areas for each neurochemical system that can be experimentally targeted in stereotaxic space. Fourth, we present a new take on an older conceptual framework \u2013 grid-based annotation \u2013 that refines the existing stereotaxic coordinate system of the atlas and leverages its use for mapping and for gentle entry of outside datasets from the published literature into the database for the community to extend its contents.",
        "Importantly, this study highlights the utility of the Brain Maps reference atlas as a data repository, taking advantage of the Adobe\u00ae Illustrator\u00ae (Ai) vector graphics workspace for the current Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) digital atlas templates, and the ability of users to use, as an alternative workspace, the free vector graphics editor, Inkscape (www.inkscape.org) as another way to access this database in the near future. The foundation of Chemopleth 1.0 consists of soon-to-be-released downloadable Ai (and Inkscape-compatible) files containing atlas templates for eight levels of the hypothalamus and zona incerta (>1840) that form base maps in BM4.0. Building upon these base maps, we plan to provide the following tools/resources:",
        "data layers above the base map containing the mapped distributions of five chemically identified neuronal populations (both their cell bodies and their labeled neurites). These populations include the vasopressin gene product, copeptin; neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS; EC 1.14.13.39), hypocretin/orexin (H1/OA), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1MSH);",
        "choropleth maps, which sort the relative abundance of distributions for the five neurochemical systems, in 3\u20137 subjects, by brain region;",
        "isopleth maps, which sort the relative abundance of distributions for the same neurochemical systems, in 3\u20137 subjects, independent of brain region; and",
        "a grid-based coordinate system, including the introduction of ephemeris tables for the distributions of these neuronal populations within this grid.",
        "The Ai and Inkscape workspaces each allow for the interactive visualization of data layer overlays over each base map. Each data layer, which can be accessed using the Layers panel in Ai (Layers and Objects panel in Inkscape), can contain its own set of spatial data that is visualizable in relation to data present in other layers \u201cin front of/above\u201d or \u201cin back of/under\u201d the layer being examined.",
        "After presenting methodological information about how the Chemopleth 1.0 database and its tools were built, we describe the mapping innovations of the database and how to navigate the digital overlays within it. We then discuss the philosophy underlying the need for these tools, highlight the contents of the database in relation to previous visualization efforts, and discuss the design features of the database, including our conceptual framework for grid-based annotation. Because this study is presenting visualization tools (downloadable vector-formatted maps with digital overlays; open-source code for spatial averaging) for a structural model (a standardized brain atlas) of a complex object in nature (the brain), our narrative draws from an eclectic set of disciplines (cartography, geosciences, computing), as well as programs in the humanities and arts \u2013 all of which include scholarly and artistic efforts to visualize, register, and annotate complex information in time and space.",
        "Chemopleth 1.0 contains data populating brain regions named in accordance with Swanson (2015), as applied to the rat brain in Brain Maps 4.0, an open-access rat brain atlas and includes standard terms. Each term is set in italics and includes the named neuroanatomical structure and the associated author-date citation that first uses the term as defined, e.g., \u201clateral hypothalamic area \u201d. For those terms where assignment of priority was not possible, they are assigned the annotation \u201c(>1840)\u201d, i.e., \u201cdefined sometime after the year 1840\u201d, a year which roughly marks the introduction of cell theory in biology, e.g., \u201cdorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (>1840)\u201d. Standard terms for gray matter regions can be found in \u201cTable C: Rat CNS Gray Matter Regions 4.0 (Topographical Histological Groupings)\u201d from the Supporting Information available online for, which is based on the scientific literature and cytoarchitectonic features of Nissl-stained tissue sections.

Importantly, any citation included within the standard term is included in the list of cited references in this study. A list of the standard terms and the abbreviations used in this study is provided in the Abbreviations section.",
        "This project has its antecedents in our early student-driven efforts to characterize activation patterns for hypocretin/orexin-immunoreactive neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area in rats receiving glycemic challenges, which led to exploration of additional cell types in this region. These efforts, which were undertaken using immunofluorescence histochemistry, evolved to include a systematic photomicrographic analysis of several tissue biomarkers in the hypothalamus from 2012\u20132015. By this time, we had also started examining the utility of axonal mapping for optogenetic applications and for examining putative synaptic interactions between labeled systems in the hypothalamus. While additional fluorescence-based efforts continued within our two-semester Brain Mapping & Connectomics undergraduate laboratory course as part of student-driven research, the learning outcomes and curriculum for which also have been reported, signal longevity and other challenges from the fluorescently-labeled tissue sets led us to realize that these patterns were best mapped using archival, non-labile staining that could be better controlled, signal-wise, across time (some of these issues have been detailed by). Therefore, alongside these efforts, we used immunoperoxidase-based labeling methods, which yield signals that remain relatively stable over time (; Sotelo et al., 2019; Sotelo et al., 2020/21).",
        "Originally, for our immunohistochemical labeling patterns, we wanted to estimate densities of labeled elements within brain regions delineated on BM4.0 atlas maps. This led to an attempt to draw each vector-delimited area in BM4.0 base maps as a \u201cshapefile\u201d within a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework. Initial shapefiles were constructed in Mar 2020 by SB by exporting Ai files as .dxf AutoCad files for use in QGIS open-access software and plots of density distributions were created within the R framework (SB, unpublished laboratory blog post, 15 Apr 2020). Our initial efforts \u201cwere successful, as far as they went\u201d (, p. 342). It soon became apparent, however, that the vector files from Ai needed to have closed polygons and exporting raster images of those regions would be more efficient than manually drawing shapefiles. It also became clear that we needed a tool \u201cto take a published [BM4.0 atlas] map used by someone to populate their data and render it back into vector format so we can align [it] with current vector maps\u201d (Khan, unpublished laboratory blog post, 21 May 2020). Therefore, we decided upon a workflow that would take vector-based shapes and export them for raster-based analysis and return them as vector graphics at the user level within the Ai graphical user interface. To achieve this, we settled upon the workflow described in the next section.",
        "Our workflow used to generate the data and populate the database operates within three major conceptual spaces: Reference, Experimental, and Computational (Figure 1). The Reference Space includes the Chemopleth 1.0 database, which provides new content for the rat brain atlas reference, the Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) rat brain atlas. Included in this Reference Space, therefore, is the actual animal subject which forms the basis of the BM4.0 atlas, an adult male 315-g Sprague Dawley rat (\u201crepresentative subject\u201d), along with the Nissl-stained brain tissue which was studied by Swanson to produce cytoarchitectonic boundaries for all major cell groups of the rat brain (\u201catlas brain\u201d); these were drawn as vector objects to form atlas maps (\u201catlas model of the brain\u201d). These atlas maps, in turn, serve as the base maps for the Chemopleth 1.0 database (Input 1 in Fig. 1).",
        "The Experimental Space, in contrast, contains the test subjects we wanted to map chemoarchitectural labeling for within the BM4.0 atlas, which would form the basis of Chemopleth 1.0. In this space, we sectioned brain samples, collecting 30 \u03bcm-thick tissue sections into two adjacent series, the first of which was stained with thionine to generate a Nissl-stained series for reference, and the other series stained for a neuropeptide or neural enzyme of interest using immunohistochemistry (detailed in). The Nissl series provides labeling patterns that reveal the overall cellularity of the tissue and allows for cytoarchitectonic parcellation of stained cell clusters into nuclei and areas. We used that spatial information to infer what the boundary conditions were for nuclei and areas for those sections immunostained in the companion series, for which full labeling was never observed as it was with the Nissl series, but which were in tissue sections close enough to the Nissl section to permit the transfer of its boundary assignments.",
        "In Figure 1, we have noted these processes in the Experimental Space with the Nissl-delimited parcellations and drawings of immunoreactive cells and neurites serving as Inputs 2 and 3, respectively, to create the single-subject maps in the Choropleth 1.0 database within the Reference Space. Thus, the single-subject maps of chemoarchitecture in Chemopleth 1.0 were a product of: (Input 1) BM4.0 digital-format base maps; overlaid with (Input 2) Nissl-delimited boundaries to guide the mapper in drawing (Input 3) the labeling patterns of immunoreactive cells and neurites for the neurochemical systems we examined over the right locations on the base map.",
        "Finally, we sought to develop cartographic methods that allow us to visualize immunoreactivity patterns in the same atlas level for more than one subject, so that consensus locations on the map could be identified across subjects where labeling was observed. To achieve this goal, we developed a Python-based workflow that allowed the cell and fiber maps from single-subjects to undergo a conversion into file formats that could then be exported out of the database and processed in Computational Space, re-entering the Reference Space as multi-subject \u201cheat maps\u201d showcasing the concordance of distributions of immunoreactivity for any given molecule we labeled. Two types of \u201cheat maps\u201d were generated (Inputs 4 and 5 in Fig. 1). The first type was a choropleth map, which scores the density of labeling as a color-coded gradient over a base map of defined territories; these vector-object territories on the base map first had to be \u2018closed\u2019 to form discrete polygons (see Section 2.5.2). The second type was an isopleth map (; Schmid & MacCannell, 1956; Barnes et al., 1970), which did not bin densities based on cytoarchitectonically bounded regions on the base map, but rather, was a computationally produced pattern based on kernel density estimation, which allows for distributions to be shown independent of the bounded cytoarchitectonic regions of the base map underneath them.",
        "In principle, as with other transformation workflows (e.g., see; Khan et al., 2018) a variety of data sources, analog or digital, could potentially enter the proposed workflow as input data with the appropriate transformations. For this study, the most basic input data consisted of single-subject maps drawn in the commercially available (for-purchase software) workspace, Adobe\u00ae Illustrator\u00ae (Ai), as data layers over a base map. These are produced within the vector graphics application itself and registered to the Brain Maps 4.0 base map which is the bottom layer (\u201cbase maps\u201d; Fig. 1) making up the database (Inputs 1 + 2 + 3, Fig. 1). A second, more derived set of data populating our database is in the form of \u201cheat maps\u201d that are created by first exporting several individual maps of a single atlas level as .PNG or .SVG files, then processed by a Python program to create the heat maps using a Gaussian filtering form of kernel density estimation, after which these maps are re-imported into the database (Inputs 4 and 5, Fig. 1). Note that we used the Ai workspace to create these files, but they can, in principle, be generated within (or imported from) the free vector graphics editor, Inkscape (www.inkscape.org). Guidance for downloading, installing and using Inkscape can be found online at the Inkscape Beginner\u2019s Guide. All procedures described below were performed within or in relation to use of Ai workspace, and hence will be discussed mainly in that context, but readers using Inkscape should be able to utilize the database, once it is released, just as readily.",
        "These procedures, which were required for us to produce atlas maps of the chemoarchitecture, will be described in detail elsewhere, and have been described thus far within our student dissertations forming the basis of this project (; also see and pp. 6\u20139 of). Below, we describe our spatial analysis of these maps to produce our final dataset that forms the Chemopleth 1.0 database; we also show how to navigate the dataset and import/register user-generated data.",
        "Our maps of immunoreactive perikarya and neurites, present within the Ai vector graphics workspace as digital overlays, were spatially analyzed outside of this workspace (\u201cComputational Space\u201d in Fig. 1) to produce novel data visualizations and tabulated measurements using Python programming language (; see for a history of Python). To prepare the data for use in Python, a script was written in JavaScript (JS) programming language that could be accessed and run within the Ai workspace to export the maps into a usable format. The JS script, Swanson Data Exporter.js, is available on GitHub.",
        "Individual data layers from the BM4.0 dataset were exported from the template files within the Ai workspace by running the JS script as described above. Perikarya mapped on the electronic atlas templates were exported as scalable vector graphic (SVG) files. Each SVG file contained the mapped antigen from one animal on one level of the atlas and the Ai artboard of the atlas level, which served as the spatial reference frame across files.",
        "Neurite maps on the atlas were exported as portable network graphic (PNG) files. Unlike the perikarya maps represented by coordinates, neurite paths were represented by raster images, with discrete bins or pixels marking the neurite trajectory. The artboard also served as a spatial reference frame across files, and the stroke width of all paths was set to approximately 5 \u03bcm before exporting.",
        "For perikaryal analysis, to prevent us from being limited by the size of the circle glyph in vector space used to mark the cells, we kept the SVG vector format of the map rather than exporting the raster. Instead, once imported as an SVG into the Python program, a raster was generated internally to represent those cells which was then computed upon to generate counts and/or to perform Gaussian blurring. For neurite maps, the entry into Python of the PNG (raster) format obviated the need for any further processing to perform the same analysis.",
        "Brain region and stereotaxic grid boundaries were exported to compute region-dependent measurements for each atlas level to produce choropleth maps (as described in Section 2.7.2). However, some brain region boundaries in Brain Maps 4.0 are only visually implied and had to be fully closed to enable proper data binning by the Python programs. Therefore, before exporting them, we converted these visually implied regions to closed polygons in Ai (Fig. 2). We found that the easiest way to obtain these polygons without manually redrawing boundaries was to use the LivePaint feature in Ai, which interpolates between existing paths that are close to each other. The feature takes a user-defined \u201cgap\u201d parameter to automatically close paths that may not be fully intersecting or touching. Lastly, we cleaned up the final regions by merging polygons that belonged to a single region such that the number of polygons equaled the number of brain regions. Then, after closing visually implied regions, we addressed the brain regions in the atlas that shared a continuous space with other regions, such as the internuclear hypothalamic area (I). For these cases, our team members (AA, VIN, SB, AMK) conferred to draw new boundaries provisionally. In this manner, all regions had discrete boundaries, which enabled region-dependent quantification of perikarya and neurite profiles. For Chemopleth 1.0, these boundaries are a necessary starting point for our analyses, but we anticipate that the boundary assignments will change as new data about the regions come to light or if further discussion warrants a redrawing of the boundaries based on new information. Readers must be aware that any boundaries they may wish to redraw would likely necessitate a re-analysis of choropleth scores, since such scores are computed over the total area occupied by each polygon.",
        "The raster approach described in Section 2.6.1 allows binning the perikaryon centroid points and neurite profiles to a uniform grid of pixels (\u201ccontrol areas\u201d) to facilitate cell and neurite counts for choropleth mapping. A useful reference to guide readers on setting such \u201ccontrol areas\u201d is provided by. The approach also allows for density estimation of perikaryon and neurite profiles by Gaussian blurring to produce isopleth maps.",
        "To visualize spatial trends of immunoreactivity in a manner that considers subtle differences in the exact atlas map placements of filled circles for perikarya that would statistically occur because of the mapper, we decided to represent each instance of an immunoreactive perikaryon and neurite segment as a normal distribution curve in two dimensions. The normal curve has a long history of describing error distributions, dating back to its mathematical formulation in 1808 (; Gauss & Davis, 1857; Pontes, 2018). Suitably, the normal curve is an appropriate representation of a mapped perikaryon (or neurite segment) since it embodies the distribution of errors, with the peak of the curve assigned as the centroid point of the plotted perikaryon and the possible alternative positions on the plot assumed to be within a normal distribution. Specifically, the sigma value (\u03c3), which determines the spread of the normal curve, can be considered a proxy for errors incurred when mapping a particular perikaryon (or neurite) to an atlas template. Based on sampling of various hypothalamic regions and measuring the diameters of perikarya (10\u201315 perikarya/region), we found the average diameter of perikarya to usually range between 10\u201320 \u03bcm. We therefore set \u03c3 to ~14 \u03bcm, which would place any perikaryon\u2019s mapped circle centroid point at ~28 \u03bcm from the first standard deviation of the Gaussian curve (third column (10 pixels) in Fig. 3), thus conservatively blurring the location information for 1\u20133 mapped perikarya. Now, if a perikaryon is ~28 \u03bcm in diameter, this means that a region with a diameter of ~28 \u03bcm can physically only contain information about one perikaryon\u2019s position. Put another way, the only time a region of 28 \u03bcm can contain information about more than one perikaryon is if there is an overlap of perikaryon positions from multiple experimental subjects. We found the probability value, or the height of the curve at the first standard deviation and used multiples of that height as thresholds to draw contours. This effectively gave us a contour for regions where densities were similar. Of course, depending on the needs of the mapper and the sizes of the cells to be mapped, one could adjust the sigma value to reflect the dimensions of other perikarya. We suggest that readers try different values based on their region of interest, the size of the perikarya in that region, and the desired granularity of the isopleth map needed.",
        "In our implementation, we used the gaussian_filter method of the Python library, SciPy, which takes as input 1) the raster image of the mapped distributions from a BM4.0 atlas template and 2) the \u03c3 value and produces a blurred version of the input image or raster. Mathematically, the blurring occurs after computing a 2-dimensional normal curve of pixel intensities at every pixel position. Moreover, this Gaussian blur method is faster than the traditional stepwise kernel-density estimation method of iterating over all perikarya and neurite segment centroids and computing the density of every point while progressively adding them together. Once the program computed the density estimation maps, the maps were passed to a contouring function to draw contours at 10\u2013100% of maximum density in 10% increments. The program then saved the contour as an SVG file which we then placed back on the map in the Ai workspace (Fig. 4).",
        "We also extended this process to visualize spatial trends of cell and fiber distributions for a given neurochemical system from multiple cases. To achieve this, we computed each density map, and before passing them to the contouring function, we combined the density maps by averaging. Then, for multiple levels, we looped through the final density maps of each level and recorded the minimum and maximum values across all levels. Finally, we generated a contour map for each level. However, this time, we provided the minimum and maximum values to the contour function, allowing the color scheme to capture the relative distribution among levels.",
        "To streamline the process of counting perikarya or estimating neurite density per region, we developed a Python program that utilizes raster brain regions and stereotaxic grid regions to automatically calculate the number of perikarya and approximate area of neurites. The data loading process for this method is identical to that used for the isopleth analysis, except that brain regions of the BM4.0 atlas were first prepared for export as described earlier in Section 2.5.2. Once the raster versions of the data were ready, we loaded the region files and iterated through all the regions across the corresponding level. At each step, we calculated the number of pixels in each data raster that overlap with the region raster.",
        "For perikaryon profiles, we tabulated the number of overlapping pixels representing the direct perikaryon profile count and applied a sampling correction. For neurite profiles, we tabulated their approximate area by scaling the count of overlapping pixels by the metric conversion factor of approximately 8 \u00d7 10\u20136 mm2/pixel (i.e., 1 pixel represents that much space in vector space). We then calculated the averages of counts or areas per level across cases of the same marker. Subsequently, we utilized the tabulated information to generate choropleth maps with brain regions serving as the bins of the map. However, instead of simply using the counts of perikarya or the area of neurites per region to color the choropleth regions, we normalized all values by the area of their respective brain regions. The final choropleth maps were saved as raster or PNG files and then placed on a data layer within the Ai atlas workspace. Next, we iterated across the averaged levels to record the lowest and highest values, which were used to assign colors that captured the relative distribution among levels of a given marker.",
        "As described previously (see Fig. 6 of Khan et al., 2018), the spatial distributions of the data plotted in the maps generated in this study were determined by superimposing the drawn boundaries of gray matter regions [see Section 2.1 for naming conventions] of the HY and ZI, determined by cytoarchitectural criteria revealed by adjacent Nissl-stained tissue sections. The cytoarchitectural criteria used in this study are based on those used by, which draw upon a wide variety of studies for each of the HY gray matter regions presented. In summary, these are the morphology, staining intensity, orientation, packing density and distribution as revealed by Nissl-stained sections. The scope of the current study includes BM4.0 atlas templates (levels 23\u201330), which cover two of the four major rostrocaudal divisions of the hypothalamus (HY) (anterior and tuberal). For each of these levels, the entire mediolateral and dorsoventral extents of the HY were analyzed, and many of these levels also included the zona incerta (>1840) (ZI) within the ventral thalamus (TH) (see Section 3.1). Cytoarchitectural boundaries of tissue sections were used to identify them as corresponding to one of the atlas levels observed in this study (plane of section analysis), which then allowed for the transfer of data from immunohistochemically stained sections to atlas templates. These same cytoarchitectural boundaries established with the use of photomicrographs of Nissl-stained tissue sections are overlaid onto the photomicrographs of immunohistochemically stained sections using Ai software to organize them into transparent layers (digital overlays). Overlays in Ai also allowed for the migration of data from tissue sections to approximate locations of all mapped perikarya and neurites onto atlas templates in this study. We distributed our profile counts across the hierarchical list of brain regions found in Table C: Rat CNS Gray Matter Regions 4.0 (Topographical Histological Groupings) from the Supporting Information available online for. Counts were made from the mapped glyphs denoting immunoreactive neuronal profiles and tabulated.",
        "Complementing our feature-based spatial referencing, we reasoned that indexing the quantitative data to an atlas-independent spatial reference system would allow the data to be readily migratable to other atlas reference spaces indexed to the same format, as we have discussed previously (see \u00a74.6.2.2 of). Accordingly, we are proposing a system to tabulate the distributions of our profile counts within a stereotaxic, grid-based spatial referencing system. This was facilitated by Swanson\u2019s inclusion of the stereotaxic coordinate system of as a data layer in the electronic vector-formatted templates of his atlas. The FMRS annotation system presented in the Results (Section 3.5.4) is essentially a refinement of the existing atlas feature and modifies the existing data layer containing the original atlas stereotaxic grid.",
        "Several checks were made of our processes for generating the datasets or use of the tools presented in Chemopleth 1.0. First, for counting procedures, our automated quantitative analysis was checked against expert, manually annotated counting (e.g., comparisons between the two methods for counting H1/OA-ir cell bodies). Second, for our isopleth map constructions, we aligned the isopleth generated for a given chemical system with the underlying single-subject maps to see if higher densities in any given subject generally reflected the trends marked by the spatial averaging of the isopleth corresponding to that chemical system (Fig. 5). Finally, though this was not a priori intended to be a validation of our maps, we found that the registration of legacy datasets from the published literature, carried out by careful replotting of the data onto base maps and aligning these with our isopleths (described next), demonstrated a marked correspondence between datasets from the pairs of studies (see Results).",
        "To migrate the datasets from and, we cropped digital photos of the older maps from the publications and placed each of them as a transparent overlay over the base map of BM4.0 that corresponded to the atlas level we imported. These were then overlaid with an additional transparent layer to mark the locations of the perikarya by placing a glyph over the underlying location where the original was mapped, taking care that the maps were aligned precisely. So re-plotted, the data of the imported study, along with the relevant overlay for our isopleth map of the same chemical system, were prepared as figures for this study in Ai.",
        "Chemopleth 1.0 will be eventually be made accessible from a standalone data repository holding a stable version of the dataset that enables further versioning (e.g., Zenodo), and the link will be provided in subsequent revisions of this draft report. The base maps forming Chemopleth 1.0 are digitally cropped portions of electronic files from the open-access Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) rat brain atlas (the unpopulated base maps can be found in the Supplementary files accompanying). The mapped datasets populating these base maps were produced by our laboratory and have been reported in and; these have been prepared for viewing within Ai/Inkscape as eight individual files, each representing a unique atlas level, in .svg format. Each file contains a BM4.0 base map of a specific atlas level and digital overlays of our maps, produced for multiple experimental subjects, for these neurochemical systems. Source code for our workflow is available as a public repository on GitHub. The source code repository contains the JavaScript (JS) and Python programs to analyze shapes and data in BM4.0. The JS programs are used to export data from Adobe Illustrator (Ai), and the Python programs are used to generate summaries, choropleth maps, and isopleth maps of the data, described in greater detail in the sections that follow. The repository also includes documentation on how to navigate the files.",
        "Chemopleth 1.0 contains a full datasets for five immunoreactive neuronal populations through a circumscribed portion of the hypothalamus (HY) and a portion of the zona incerta (>1840) (ZI) within the ventral thalamus (TH) in multiple subjects. The database includes the profile distributions of perikarya (cell bodies) and neurites (axons and/or dendrites) that were observed to be immunoreactive for one of the following macromolecules: (1) the pre-pro-vasopressin gene product, copeptin; (2) neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS; EC 1.14.13.39); (3) hypocretin 1/orexin A (H1/OA); (4) melanin concentrating hormone (MCH); or (5) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1MSH). Within the BM4.0 reference atlas, the HY is represented by 22 coronal-plane atlas levels (abbreviated here as \u2018S\u2019 with superscripted level numbers), containing boundaries derived directly from Nissl-stained sections (from 22 companion plates) in the same atlas. These levels, S15\u201336, are samples of a 5.45 mm-long anteroposterior expanse of tissue located between +0.45 and \u20135.00 mm from Bregma (\u03b2) (from a rat inferred to be in the flat-skull position). Similarly, the portion of the TH containing the ZI is represented through a 3.72 mm-long anteroposterior expanse of tissue by 13 atlas levels (S25\u201337) located between \u20131.53 and \u20135.25 mm from \u03b2.",
        "In this study, we elected to create standardized maps for the distributions of immunoreactive perikarya and neurites through eight levels of BM4.0 (S23\u201330), ranging from \u20131.08 to \u20133.25 mm (from \u03b2), which represents 39.8% coverage (2.17 mm) of the HY, and 46.2% coverage of the ZI (1.72 mm, between \u20131.53 and \u20133.25 mm from \u03b2) (Figure 6). This selected expanse of tissue falls approximately within that which has been apportioned as the anterior and tuberal regions of the HY (; after Clark, 1938; also see). In the narrative that follows, we use \u201canterior\u201d to refer to HY represented within S23\u201325 and \u201ctuberal\u201d to refer to HY represented within S26\u201330.",
        "The soon-to-be-released Chemopleth 1.0 database is a collection of different maps of immunoreactive chemoarchitecture for the rat hypothalamus (HY) and zona incerta (>1840) (ZI). This chemoarchitecture includes immunoreactive cell bodies (perikarya) and neurites (axons and/or dendrites). We classify axons and/or dendrites as \u201cneurites\u201d and do not distinguish between them for two main reasons. First, the immunoreactivity we observe does not always allow us to distinguish between the two protoplasmic extensions based on morphological assessment. Second, since there are instances reported in the HY where an axon can extend from a primary dendrite rather than the cell body, some of the neurites, as drawn, may be portions of both (hence, the \u201cand/or\u201d designation; also, see for examples of certain hypothalamic peptidergic systems, not studied here, that also have hybrid extensions).",
        "There are two main classes of maps, either for a single subject or for multiple subjects.",
        "These maps are of two kinds: 1) a single-label map of immunoreactive cells and fibers for a neurochemical system (e.g., nNOS), representing data from the study by; and 2) dual-label maps, where two neurochemical systems were stained and mapped in the same tissue section (e.g., nNOS and aMSH), representing data from the study by. Each single-subject map includes separate maps for cell bodies (perikarya) and neurites (axons and/or dendrites). Thus, for the single-label map, we have separate maps for cell bodies and neurites (two maps). For the dual-label maps involving two neurochemical systems, we have four maps (two for cell bodies and two for neurites). Additionally, we went further with the dual-label maps as described in and added an additional (fifth) map which marks locations where putative synaptic appositions between the two neurochemical systems were checked under bright field illumination at high power. Figure 7a provides an example of several single-label, single-subject maps (each for MCH-immunoreactive neurites) visualized together on a base map (these single-subject maps were superimposed on a single base map, with each map on its own transparent data layer; read more about data layers in Section 4).",
        "These maps are also of two main kinds. First, choropleth maps are area-delimited \u201cheat maps\u201d providing color-coded magnitudes for distribution densities of cell bodies or neurites for each neurochemical system we investigated. Fig. 7b shows an example of how multiple single-subject MCH-immunoreactive neurite representations shown in Fig. 7a become represented as areal densities across subjects. Each atlas region on the base map is coded by a different color depending on the magnitude of areal density of the immunoreactive fibers within that bounded region. These regions were first prepared for choropleth analysis as described in Section 2.5.2 and then the analysis was performed on these regions as described in Section 2.6.2. Thus, choropleth maps provide heat map assignments confined by cytoarchitectonic region and divided over the areal limit of that region.",
        "Second, a separate type of multi-subject representation within Chemopleth 1.0 is in the form of an isopleth map, which is a heat map providing color-coded locations of sparse versus dense distributions of cell bodies or neurites independent of the underlying boundaries for regions on the base map (i.e., the density is not divided over the area of a specific bounded brain region). An example of an isopleth map of MCH-immunoreactive neurites is shown in Fig. 7c. This map is a collection of contours which mark the average densities of perikaryon or neurite locations on the base map across multiple subjects. Areas which are color-coded in yellow in the figure are denser and reflect greater spatial consensus of the immunoreactive elements across all experimental subjects; those areas coded lighter and duller in shading are areas of lower density, where the presence of immunoreactive elements was found in only one or a few experimental subjects. While the overall isopleth map reflects the consensus of mapped immunoreactive elements from multiple subjects, it must be borne in mind that these maps should not be considered as \u201cprobabilistic\u201d maps, since the sample sizes are low and therefore the relative contributions of any single subject\u2019s distributions to skew the overall distribution patterns is greater when samples are fewer in number (in our study, n=3\u20137 subjects).",
        "Keeping this caveat in mind, and consistent with the appearance of a bright region on the choropleth map shown in Fig. 7b, the isopleth map in Fig. 7c reflects bright (i.e., denser) consensus distributions on the base map that, when superimposed on the choropleth map, agree with it (Fig. 7d). Notice that while the bright yellow color-coding of the isopleth distributions falls within the bounded territory color-coded as bright green in the choropleth map, the yellow distributions do not completely occupy this green territory but, rather, mark a subset of immunoreactive elements in this area, illustrating how the isopleth distributions provide finer spatial resolution of the distributions at the \u03c3 value we assigned (see Section 2.7.2). Having understood these types of data visualization, we next turn to how readers can utilize the Adobe\u00ae Illustrator\u00ae (Ai) vector graphics platform to access and use our database files. We note, however, that users can also visualize Chemopleth 1.0 files in the freely downloadable software, Inkscape.",
        "To accurately use the master files when they become available in a subsequent version of this report, it is important to keep the dimensions of the original Ai files downloaded from the Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) publication. There are eight atlas levels (numbered 23\u201330) from BM4.0 covering the anterior and tuberal hypothalamus (HY), and portions of the zona incerta (>1840) (ZI), of an adult male rat. An example of a database file opened in Ai is provided in Figure 8, where BM4.0 level 23 was opened (using Adobe\u00ae Illustrator\u00ae 2020). Note that the layout might look slightly different depending on what workspace option you choose. Here we have the workspace set in \u201cEssentials Classic mode\u201d; however, any workspace will have the same tools, just with a different layout.

The lock icon is to lock the layer, preventing any moving or deleting of data on that data layer.",
        "Chemopleth 1.0 is accessed via the Layers panel in the Ai platform. There are three experimental subjects per pair of immunoreactive antigen, and each will have sublayers with their corresponding antigen, with additional nested sublayers for appositions, cell bodies, and fibers (Fig. 9). Layers contain artwork (i.e., the data) and are arranged in a stack. As shown in Figure 10, content on layers located at the top of the Layers panel (e.g., \u201cFrame\u201d, \u201cbrainRegions\u201d) appear on top of content on layers that are lower in the Layers panel (e.g., \u201catlas\u201d, \u201cisopleths\u201d, \u201cgrid\u201d). Isopleths show spatially averaged density maps of the distributions of immunoreactive elements, showing regions of consensus (and discordant) distributions across multiple subjects independent of cytoarchitectural boundaries marked on the underlying base map. In contrast, choropleth maps provide distribution gradients normalized and bounded by the cytoarchitectural boundaries of the underlying base map. See and for details concerning the distributions of these immunoreactive biomarkers and their biological significance.",
        "Fig. 11 provides a summary of how Chemopleth 1.0 contains a base map for each BM4.0 atlas level (see 1 in Fig. 11), upon which single-subject maps were produced for each immunoreactive system we labeled, using copeptin-immunoreactive neurites as the example (Fig. 11, 2) (in this instance, only the neurites immunoreactive for copeptin are made visible by toggling off the visibility for the layer with copeptin-immunoreactive perikarya).",
        "Fig. 11 also shows two types of multi-subject map, which were produced by exporting the single-subject maps (as described in the Fig. 1 workflow) and computing across them to produce averaged \u201cheat maps\u201d. The color-coded density scorings of these maps were binned by cytoarchitectonic region (to produce a choropleth map) or sorted into a distribution that was independent of the cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the base map (thereby producing an isopleth map) (Fig. 11, 3).",
        "For certain experimental subjects (see Figure 9) we also performed a spatial analysis of the locations for putative synaptic appositions between two neurochemical systems. For these cases, an additional map was placed in a Layer called \u201cAppositions\u201d.",
        "This coordinate system is displayed as an 8.0 \u00d7 12.0 mm grid overlay (layer) within each Ai-formatted electronic BM4.0 atlas level template used in this study, with the origin located on the lower left corner of the coronal plane hemi-section (Figure 12a). The x-axis of this grid (which marks the mediolateral (ML) stereotaxic coordinates of each atlas map) is 8.0 mm in length, and the y-axis of the grid (which marks the dorsoventral (DV) stereotaxic coordinates of the map) is 12.0 mm in length. Note, however, that the maximal dimensions vary depending on the position of the brain section within each specific atlas level (i.e., some levels will have tissue expanses spanning fewer lengths.",
        "We define the lines parallel to the y-axis (sagittal lines, or sagittals) by the numerals 0\u20137, with 0 marking 0.0 mm ML (the ML coordinate at the origin), 1 marking 1.0 mm ML, and so on, until the final numeral 7, which marks the penultimate sagittal at 7.0 mm ML. Sagittals located on the right-hand hemisphere of the map are denoted by a plus sign (+) before their respective numeral, and those on the left-hand hemisphere are denoted by a minus sign (\u2013). For example, +5 marks the sagittal located +5.0 mm along the ML stereotaxic axis in the right-hand hemisphere map of a given BM4.0 atlas map. In similar fashion, we assigned alphabetical designations (A\u2013L) for the lines parallel to the x-axis (horizontal lines, or horizontals), which correspond to numerical values of the dorsoventral coordinate (\u20131.0 to \u201312.0 mm). Note that these numbers grow more negative in value from dorsal to ventral along the map. Thus, J denotes the position of the horizontal that is 10.0 mm ventral (i.e., \u201310.0 mm DV) to the most dorsal edge of the map (which is located at position 0.0).",
        "Together, the sagittal and horizontal designations can be used to identify specific grid zones or tiles within the map, with the convention adopted to name each tile based on the ventromedial corner intersection of each sagittal and horizontal. The notation for grid zones for our database based on the 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 mm squares created by the stereotaxic lines follows the format: \u00b1 (numeric signifier (0.00 \u2013 8.00 mm) of the ML coordinate; alphabetical signifier (A\u2013L) of the DV coordinate), with + marking coordinates on the right-side of the atlas map and \u2013 marking coordinates for the left side of the atlas map. For example, tile +8E denotes the tile that has its lower left corner marking the intersection of sagittal +8 with horizontal E. Note that ventromedial positioning means that the left side of the atlas map would have the corresponding tile (\u20138E), with the lower right corner marking the intersection of sagittal \u20138 with horizontal E, since the lower right corner would be more medial than the lower left corner (Figure 12b). We opted to designate the ventromedial corner rather than an absolute direction (e.g., \u201clower left\u201d corner), since selection of the medial corner for corresponding locations on both hemispheres ensures that each grid zone in one hemisphere has the identical but opposite-sign grid zone name in the contralateral hemisphere. Thus \u20134G and +4G would mark grid zones in the left and right hemispheres for bilaterally corresponding territories of brain tissue space.",
        "Using this refined grid-based stereotaxic coordinate system, we tabulated our counts for immunoreactive perikarya and/or neurites within this grid using a new annotation system we call the FMRS annotation system (FMRS = \u201cFrequencies Mapped with Reference to Sterotaxy), which essentially are counts of these immunoreactive elements binned by grid zone as opposed to brain regions (Figure 13). An FMRS, an acronym we use as a noun and pronounced similarly to the word ephemeris (see Section 4.2.3.2 for rationale), is a table of positions of spatial data points (in this case, profile counts) in stereotaxic coordinate space obtained from a single observation or a few observations (i.e., a single subject or a few subjects), with each entry in the FMRS consisting of the following values: anteroposterior (bregma) coordinate (in mm), grid zone or tile defined by a specific sagittal and horizontal intersection, and profile count (frequency of perikaryon profiles or a pixel-density score for neurites) in that zone.",
        "We generated several FMRS, each keyed to a single bregma coordinate. To construct each FMRS from any data-populated BM4.0 atlas level within Ai, the visibility of the data layer featuring the vector-formatted cytoarchitectonic boundaries was toggled off, and the visibilities of the data layers with glyphs for immunoreactive perikarya or neurite profiles and the Paxinos & Watson-derived stereotaxic grid were toggled on, allowing the profile counts to be parsed by grid zone within reference space.",
        "Figures 14\u201319 show the results of placing legacy data in register with our current maps in Chemopleth 1.0. Specifically, we migrated the data from, which was mapped in BM3.0 reference space, into BM4.0 reference space and placed their data in register with our datasets for MCH- and H1/OA-immunoreactive perikarya distributions (Figs. 14, 15). We also migrated data in from BM2.0 space to BM4.0 space (Figs. 16\u201319).",
        "In this study, we populate the base maps freely available from the Brain Maps 4.0 rat brain atlas (\u201cBM4.0\u201d) with new datasets to create Chemopleth 1.0, an interactive spatial database of chemoarchitecture for portions of the rat hypothalamus and zona incerta. Chemopleth 1.0, which, when released with a subsequent version of this report, will be accessible using Adobe Illustrator (Ai) or the free software platform, Inkscape (www.inkscape.org), and will provide a detailed view of the cell body and axonal fiber distributions of five neurochemical systems to aid in their targeted functional examination in stereotaxic space. As part of this new resource, a programmed workflow was developed that allows the user to export cell and neurite data from the atlas in tabular and raster formats, compute on these data, and export data visualizations of spatially averaged \u201cheat maps\u201d derived from individual data maps from multiple subjects. These maps are produced in a file format that is compatible with their re-importation into the native atlas environment. The database includes two types of these maps, one providing density estimates by cytoarchitectural region (\u201cchoropleth\u201d maps) and the other providing density patterns that are computed across territory in a manner independent of the underlying cytoarchitectural boundaries (\u201cisopleth\u201d maps). Additionally, we introduce a new grid-based annotation system, based on the stereotaxic grid provided in the atlas, to allow non-expert neuroscientists to map their own data within the atlas without needing training in detailed cytoarchitectural mapping methods. Finally, we provide guidance in this report on navigating the Ai workspace to access and make sense of the spatial data contained in the database.",
        "Below, we discuss the need for this database, and then focus on its contents and design features. Throughout, we reflect upon the database\u2019s design, environment and assumptions with discussion that draws upon programs in geology, geography and geographical information sciences, the humanities, and the visual, literary, and performative arts. The net is deliberately cast wide to emphasize the shared \u2018experimental entanglements\u2019 of our collective efforts to model, visualize, and make sense of complex, spatiotemporal data and to also learn how such tasks are carried out by those outside of our immediate discipline.",
        "In the past three decades, the identification of molecular constituents of hypothalamic and zona incerta systems has outpaced their spatial mapping. This identification has involved transcriptomic, proteomic or peptidomic analyses of sampled tissues from these regions. Most of the detailed published molecular studies of this kind have either been performed in laboratory mice, were not intended to (and therefore do not) provide actual mapped spatial information but only dimensionality reduction visualizations (e.g., tSNE plots), and/or have sampled denser nuclei at the expense of more diffusely organized areas (reviewed by Khan et al., 2018). In contrast, older, more concerted mapping efforts have provided maps of rat brain chemical systems, but these have largely done so as part of larger whole-brain survey efforts (this is exemplified by the excellent Handbook of Chemical Neuroanatomy series, many volumes of which remain out of print at the time of this writing). These studies included the hypothalamus and zona incerta, but they often lack the spatial resolution or coordinate space to facilitate precise targeting of the chemical systems with virally directed tools; such tools aid in targeting neurochemical systems in the rat, which has few transgenic lines (see Section 4.1.2). Finally, most published reports of chemoarchitecture for the rat hypothalamus and zona incerta have focused on mapping cell bodies; only a few have mapped axonal fibers, the locations for which are important to map in order to target retrogradely transportable vectors.",
        "Recently, Paxinos and colleagues published the third edition of their chemoarchitectonic rat brain atlas, which contains photomicrographs of tissue immunostained with eight neuronal markers, two of which are well-established proxy markers for known bona fide neurotransmitter systems (tyrosine hydroxylase for catecholaminergic neurons) and NADPH-diaphorase (for nitrergic neurons). Chemopleth 1.0 complements this effort by providing detailed hypothalamic and zona incerta maps in the rat for neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurons (another means to identify presumptive nitrergic neurons) as well as for four additional neurochemical systems.",
        "The laboratory rat has been a mainstay of neuroscientific research for over a century (e.g.,; see for a nuanced historical contextualization), with a rich scientific literature concerning neural substrates and their causal links to behavior and physiology. While leveraging this information affords scientists with immense benefits when probing deeper into structure-function relationships for the nervous system, there historically have been limitations in the genetic tractability of this model organism. This, however, appears to be changing dramatically as new programmable nuclease tools gain currency.",
        "Thus, at the time of this writing, a few transgenic rat lines exist to aid in labeling and identifying specific chemoarchitecture in the rat brain, and more lines are being generated, especially using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool (reviewed by). In most cases, however, detailed comparisons of transgenic neuropeptide expression patterns with wild-type controls are still lacking, and no detailed standardized atlas-based mapping for transgenically expressed rat chemoarchitecture has yet been reported. In the more rigorously characterized lines, such as the TH-Cre rat, unexpected germline recombination with a parental sex bias has been reported. This is also a wider problem for numerous transgenic lines of mice and zebrafish used in neuroscientific research (Luo et al., 2020), reinforcing the calls for observing careful breeding and genotyping procedures when using these important and valuable model organisms. Maps of wild-type rat brain chemoarchitecture, therefore, will be important for validating transgenic patterns of expression, even as the models undergo refinement and improvement, and such datasets begin coming online. Chemopleth 1.0 provides a useful starting point to facilitate such comparisons against five different neurochemical systems in wild-type rats.",
        "The need for maps of wild-type rat chemoarchitecture is also evident in the field of machine learning and computer vision, where efforts to automate or semi-automate the mapping of chemoarchitectural systems will require deep learning algorithms to improve their performance by computing on enough training data that can serve as ground truth. While a small amount of histological data can be bootstrapped to increase the amount of training data (e.g.,), and for certain deep learning approaches a small training set of macroscale histological data (MRI images) may suffice for effective neural network performance, it is also evident from other studies that a large amount of such data can be a better means to achieve accuracy in computer-vision-based pattern recognition methods. At the time of this writing, mesoscale histological datasets, such as the ones we are providing here, have not yet been evaluated to determine the minimal effective amount of training data needed for robust pattern recognition to facilitate their mapping to a standardized atlas.",
        "Finally, current methods to label and visualize rat chemoarchitecture in 3-D (for example, by light sheet microscopic imaging) need spatial validation from 2-D tissue sets produced by separate methodology, particularly with respect to cytoarchitectural patterns where Nissl stains have long served as a gold standard and for which compatible methods in cleared whole tissue samples are still undergoing refinements.",
        "In Chemopleth 1.0, we provide single- and multi-subject chemoarchitectural data visualizations for five neurochemical systems across eight Brain Maps atlas levels through the anterior and tuberal hypothalamus and parts of the zona incerta (>1840). Each atlas level from Brain Maps 4.0 is represented by a single base map of the hypothalamus/zona incerta that can be opened in Adobe\u00ae Illustrator\u00ae (Ai) or in Inkscape. The atlas file consists of a stack of data layers placed over the base map. The data layers are labeled according to experimental subject and the neurochemical immunoreactivity patterns being shown, with sublayers sorted according to the type of data being shown (immunoreactive patterns for cell bodies, neurites, and appositions). In addition to base maps and evidence-based cytoarchitecture, the database also includes the following contents:",
        "The first major class of map produced from these efforts are called feature-based maps because they not only document the features of the immunoreactive patterns we are seeking to map, but also because these patterns are drawn with respect to brain regional boundary assignments that are first drawn as a base map in the atlas from the cytoarchitectonic features of Nissl-stained tissue series serving as the reference. Indeed, both the boundaries and the immunoreactive patterns are basic features of the landscape and are manually drawn by observation of photomicrographic data or, as in the case of other disciplines (e.g.,), drawings from direct lens-based observations. These feature-based maps are for single subjects (see next section) but can be transformed into multi-subject consensus maps of two kinds (see Section 4.2.1.2).",
        "Strictly speaking, the mapped elements on the base map mark the locations of profiles of cell parts: perikaryal profiles, axonal or dendritic profiles, putative apposition profiles. The locations of the perikaryal profiles drawn over the base map are represented in 1:1 registration with the location of the profile observed in photomicrographs of the native immunostained tissue. In the case of a putative apposition, the drawn profile marked the location that was in registration with the location observed on the actual tissue slide as it was visualized under a \u00d7100 oil objective lens through the z-axis by a trained student. Thus, one circle glyph marks the position of one profile for each perikaryon or putative apposition. To the extent possible, this approach was also followed for immunoreactive neurite profiles but was not always maintained for especially dense regions of neurites, where it was difficult to distinguish individual elements from each other. In those instances, the overall trends of density and directionality were drawn to represent the overall spatial organization of the data overlaid on the base map.",
        "One way in which neuroanatomical mapping between subjects can be reconciled is using deformation or warping algorithms that normalize a subject\u2019s brain anatomy to fit a standardized template. Such efforts require validation by comparing \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d dispositions of known landmarks within the tissue, as has been performed for human MRI images (e.g.,) and for mouse and rat brains (e.g.,). In such instances, the landmarks selected are identified using an expert human actor trained to recognize such landmarks, providing a expert-guided validation. An alternative approach, where the comparison across subjects occurs without warping but through structural analysis, has also been conducted by various groups and formally described. We opted for a hybrid approach for Chemopleth 1.0; in this case, each subject was first mapped by an expert to the BM4.0 standardized atlas and then the final map from each subject for a given atlas level was spatially averaged to produce the two classes of multi-subject maps described below. With this approach, the need to warp was obviated by the direct intervention of an expert mapper to transfer neuroanatomical data to atlas templates with the aid of Nissl-based parcellation and manual registration.",
        "We opted to include choropleth-based mapping to follow traditional approaches to tabulating distribution differences with respect to cytoarchitectonic boundary conditions set in place by Nissl-delimited brain region assignments that produced the atlas reference space we are using as a model. The data visualization in this format should be considered as a semi-quantitative assessment of densities bounded by cytoarchitectonic region within the base map (i.e., the density values were normalized by bounded area). Automated quantitative analysis is dependent on the boundary conditions we set for those regions without explicit boundary knowledge available from the Nissl-based cytoarchitecture. These determinations, therefore, should be considered purely as a starting point, and the datasets can be re-analyzed under different boundary delimitations in the future to refine these assessments.",
        "A new tool introduced in this database is the isopleth map. Like choropleth maps, isopleth maps denote differences in areal density for the cell populations being mapped across multiple subjects, with the concentrations in darker shading denoting \u201ccore\u201d population densities, surrounded by lighter shaded territories representing sparser densities of the cells. However, unlike choropleth maps, isopleth maps display density distributions that are not confined to cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the base map. The design features of this mapping method are discussed in Section 4.3; here, we focus on what the maps might be revealing about the native distributions of these neuronal populations.",
        "Economy of space is believed to consolidate cellular populations apart from fiber systems, and the lateral hypothalamic reticular pathways have been described to contact leptodendritic cells which are more sparsely distributed within perpendicularly oriented configurations with respect to ascending and descending fiber systems (; see). Recently, evidence has been furnished that lateral hypothalamic populations in the mouse form ultra-sparse connections among themselves; this may be true for the rat as well.",
        "Some of the lightly shaded areas in our isopleth maps are likely marking regions that actually harbor cell populations, but which were not immunostained and therefore not mapped in our studies. However, apparent cell-sparse zones may reflect a true dearth of perikarya in the territories traversed by the main ascending and descending fiber components of the medial forebrain bundle, which has been observed to be \u201ccoextensive\u201d with the lateral hypothalamic area (, p. 67). Our preliminary investigation into fiber contributions to the mfb has demonstrated that corticohypothalamic projections from the infralimbic area arise within the several subregions of the LHA, with >60% of these connections forming putative appositions with hypocretin/orexin (H1/OA)-immunoreactive perikarya ipsilaterally. It is noteworthy that we observe relatively sparse distributions of H1/OA neurons in the LHAd in the vicinity of these fibers, underscoring the idea that the ultra-sparse connectivity reported in this region in the mouse may also extend to spatial organization in the rat.",
        "What would the functional significance of sparse connectivity in this region be? One possible explanation is that these relatively sparser areas may be sources of information flow outside of the main centers of cellularity, evoking patterns strikingly reminiscent of karesansui, or Japanese dry landscape gardens and other representations of scattered particulate landscapes, where there may be discrete denser aggregates (Guidi, 2023) surrounded by areas of flow. Evidence is mounting that the brain\u2019s interstitial spaces include extracellular elements that may serve to synergize communication with the cytoarchitectonically defined areas they surround; these elements include not only glia, but blood vessels (Scremin, 1970), perineuronal nets and other non-neuronal cell types. Local, non-point-to-point neuronal communication via neuromodulation or graded neurotransmission that does not requires action potentials (; also see), or forms of volume transmission which may not involve neuronal elements, may serve to interconnect all these elements as part of a larger hybridized or even \u201cextra-connectomic\u201d network. Even among neuropeptidergic cell clusters, for example, in the hypothalamus, the geometry of these arrangements may permit neurons to respond selectively to specific electrical oscillations in the surrounding tissue.",
        "In relation to neuronal geometry, blood vessel contributions also appear to be significant occupiers of interstitial space in the hypothalamus (Scremin, 1970), and probably exert an influence on geometric determinations of clustered neuronal populations in the hypothalamus, given the reported synergy that blood vessels generally appear to have with neurons during development of shared pathways in tissue space. Indeed, there appear to be spatial correlations in the hypothalamus between dense neuronal clusters and dense vascular patterns, such as that reported for the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. This is especially likely for the chemoarchitecture we examined, particularly copeptin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase and melanin-concentrating hormone, which appear to also occasionally aggregate in clusters around blood vessel cross-sections in the medial and lateral hypothalamic zones (Khan, unpublished observations). Clustered assemblies of neurons along vascular routes may provide alternative routes for communication, much as indigenous communities clustered around riverbanks have networks that bypass traditional overland routes. For melanin-concentrating hormone, for example, evidence for volume transmission through the vasculature and cerebrospinal fluid has been furnished. Understanding such neuronal-vascular relationships may contribute greatly to our understanding of how communication is carried out in the hypothalamus (e.g., see), relationships that isopleth mapping and future registration of angioarchitectural datasets could help reveal.",
        "Collectively, these considerations of extra-neuronal elements challenge our current understanding of whether cytoarchitectonically determined boundary conditions in the brain reflect functional distinctions, and may render such conditions irrelevant at larger scales of visualization and functional integration, much as boundary conditions established by political or colonial elements on the ground become less influential or even meaningless from the vantage point of higher elevations. Indeed, at a fundamental level, it is evident that processes visualized at one scale do not necessarily have operations that are as salient at larger or smaller scales (, pp. 91ff.) \u2013 the misunderstanding of which contributes to the so-called \u201cscaling fallacy\u201d (e.g., see, pp. 214\u2013215, pp. 43\u201345). It is now well documented, for example, that cortical microstructure may not be reflected in the organization of macroscopic borders. Indeed, it is also not yet clear that macroscale connectivity measures obtained from resting-state fMRI or diffusion tractography correlate with underlying mesoscale axonal connectivity, with some studies reporting poor correlations and others reporting stronger ones (see for discussion).",
        "The advantage of isopleth mapping, which we are performing here at the mesoscale, is that the distribution patterns we observe for these neuronal populations are not constrained to Nissl-defined boundaries and more accurately reveal the spaces in between nucleated aggregates of cells, the precise geometry of which, even if not yet discernible at the microscopic scale, could nevertheless undergird observable phenomena at larger scales. If larger-scale functions are in play that transcend cytoarchitectonic boundaries, the isopleth distributions could, in principle, either reflect such functions structurally in a way not yet known to us; alternatively, they can, at the very least, be placed in register with future structural maps that may better reflect such functional operations.",
        "In addition to providing a liberation from Nissl-delimited cytoarchitectonic space, the isopleth mapping that we provide here for five immunoreactive neurochemical systems in the hypothalamus and zone incerta also provide for greater considerations of chemoarchitectural changes in time. The idea that there exist species-typical patterns of connectivity which break down at the individual level, where stochastic difference may account for variation is not a new one (e.g., see), and has been discussed by many biologists, including neuroscientists wrestling with the idea of how changes in the brain may be reflected as changes in external phenotype, whether this manifests in the form of structure or function.",
        "In our isopleth maps, we may be looking at zones of constancy and zones of variability that have been selected for during evolution, which leads to the realization that we are juxtaposing mapped structures to reveal varying depths of change over evolutionary time. Areas that may confer survivability may in fact be also correlated with areas that display strongly concordant immunoreactive patterns across individual subject where the structure-function relationships of such areas are too critical for survival to change drastically over time. However, those variable regions that are evident may reflect areas of the brain that are selected for evolutionarily to remain plastic and changing to confer behavioral flexibility, what is termed the ability of natural selection pressures to allow for different evolutionary strategies over time. Much as scientists have painstakingly examined the morphological variations of the Gal\u00e1pagos finches and determined that they satisfy the salient conditions necessary for evolution to occur (i.e. variability in the population, heritability of these varied traits, and their contributions to the finches\u2019 reproductive success; Weiner, 1994), it becomes clear that atlas-based mapping of chemoarchitecture from multiple animals into a common reference framework allows for a constrained evaluation of morphological variation to be made lawfully. This exercise, in turn, sets the stage for formulating testable hypotheses as to whether such variations in immunoreactive distributions are state-dependent within the lifetime of the subject (as many of them most surely are), or are overlaid by longer-term factors that account for their variability across the subject\u2019s lineage over time (Khan, unpublished laboratory blog posts entitled \u201cUltraconserved Elements I, II, III\u201d, 25 Oct 19, 3 Nov 19, and 24 Feb 20). This question, namely, the degree to which individual variation among subjects is the result of deep evolutionary change rather than individual lifetime-bounded state changes is one that is tackled routinely by scientists studying geometric morphometrics, which could be applied eventually to our datasets as well, once a suitable sample size is achieved.",
        "The original hard copy edition of Brain Maps: Structure of the Rat Brain included a transparent overlay that could be aligned to each base map which bore calibration marks for the stereotaxic coordinates for the stereotaxic coordinate system. Their system is considered the gold standard coordinate system for targeting probes to brain structures mapped in their atlas or \u2013 in the case of Brain Maps \u2013 any reference atlas that is produced in register with the plane of the Paxinos and Watson atlas. Since that first edition, the Brain Maps reference atlas has included this stereotaxic coordinate system as a data layer embedded within each atlas file. The Chemopleth 1.0 database retains this data layer of inferred stereotaxic coordinates, and we introduce a new, named coordinate system for this coordinate framework that allows grid-based mapping of data for the first time. Section 4.3.4 describes this design feature in greater detail.",
        "We selected the acronym, FMRS, because it phonetically resembles the word ephemeris, which is the term for a table of positions of celestial objects (e.g., planets) that has been used by many civilizations and cultures since antiquity (Gingerich, 1997; also see zij:; see for a notable example of a published ephemeris). We use \u201cFMRS\u201d in the same way as \u201cephemeris\u201d is used in a sentence (i.e., as a noun and not an adjective; thus \u201can FMRS\u201d, not \u201can FMRS table\u201d). Also, we use \u201cFMRS\u201d as both a singular and plural noun: \u201cone FMRS\u201d, \u201cmany FMRS\u201d. We opted to use FMRS rather than ephemeris for two reasons: (1) the acronym emphasizes its roots as a tabulation in stereotaxic space and not celestial coordinate space (i.e., Frequencies Mapped with Reference to Stereotaxy); and (2) it does not dilute, expand, or confuse the use of ephemeris, as used in astronomy, but still pays tribute to it as essentially the same concept: an annotated tabulation of positional information for observed objects in a coordinate space.",
        "Also worth noting is the fact that ephemeris is closely related to \u201cephemeral\u201d, which denotes \u201cshort-lived\u201d or \u201cmomentary\u201d; ephemeris (and by extension, FMRS), therefore, emphasizes that the counts or frequencies recorded in each grid zone represent those of a single experiment or observation in one subject within a circumscribed set of space-time conditions, and that these frequencies are being used by a single laboratory to model such distributions as they may appear across subjects. Therefore, they should be treated as a limited representation of more generalized states or phenomena. In other words, FMRS notations are of circumscribed experimental observations. Much as positional information tabulated in an ephemeris is dependent on the local conditions where such observations were recorded from, so, too, are the frequencies binned to stereotaxic grid zones dependent on the laboratory making the observations, the condition of the experimental subject they are studying, the conditions and parameters of their labeling experiments, etc. In Section 4.3.4.3, we discuss the advantages the use of this grod-based annotation system may afford investigators seeking a general summary of which brain areas to target experimentally and how such a system is a straightforward way to map distributions without needing training or expert knowledge in feature-based (i.e., cytoarchitectonic) mapping.",
        "We now turn to the published data we registered to our own datasets. Specifically, we have re-plotted the spatial positions of three neuronal populations reported in two studies: (hypocretin 1/orexin A, nitric oxide synthase) and (hypocretin 1/orexin A, melanin-concentrating hormone). A few points are worth noting regarding this registration.",
        "First, the alignment of these data with our own isopleth maps of these populations reveals a strikingly concordant overlap across our collective studies. This alignment is striking because the methods used to map these populations were not shared between those laboratories and our own, nor were the methods used to generate the histological staining patterns identical. The registration underscores how standardized atlasing of data provides a means to readily explore similarities and differences among experimental results generated by investigators separated in time and space and who may use resources and methods that are similar, but not identical. Such investigators, who \u201cshare the same spaces\u201d and are essentially \u201cperforming the same movements\u201d, can operate out of isolation and into a shared intellectual commons where they can help build, refine, and interrogate a shared spatial model of the brain (discussed in; also see). Indeed, apart from the Swanson laboratory\u2019s own use of the Brain Maps reference space, many other labs report mapped data for the hypothalamus or zona incerta plotted in this space, including mRNA and/or protein expression patterns, chemical/electrode lesions or electrode placements, chemical microinjection sites, cellular activation patterns, neuroanatomical tract-tracer injection sites and tracer-labeled cell bodies and fibers, and optogenetic fiber placements. It is hoped that Chemopleth 1.0 allows for such a model to grow and evolve for the rat hypothalamus and zona incerta by collective efforts of the scientific community. Ultimately, the use of inference engines and artificial intelligence across such layered datasets could provide explicit linkages and hypothesis generation for future data-constrained experiments, as has been recently shown in archaeological research, and of relevance, in linking structural brain variations with down-scale genetics and larger-scale autism phenotypes. The targeting of this mapped chemoarchitecture could literally and conceptually be refined by such linkages.",
        "Second, the use of artificial intelligence notwithstanding, the digital overlays afforded by the Ai environment (see Section 4.3.1) already reveal explicit evidentiary and historical relationships among disparate sets of data. Figure 17 provides a simple example of how overlays can provide a shorthand form of citation that links a newly reported dataset (for example, the distributions of MCH-immunoreactive neurons; present study) with previous efforts \u201cwithin\u201d the same reference space (identification of premotor-parasympathetic MCH-immunoreactive neurons). A prepared digital overlay of another laboratory\u2019s data is essentially a form of data curation from the literature that speeds up the process of understanding how such data relate to one\u2019s own during the process of literature-based study of previous work in one\u2019s field. This approach of registering published datasets to these BM4.0 base maps is very much in keeping with the standard set by for the atlas itself, ever since its first edition, where an appendix was included which relates the majority of all brain regions and areas to the published literature. As Swanson has himself stated, the atlas is essentially a hypothesis (Swanson, personal communication to AMK), with each region\u2019s boundaries undergoing refinements as more evidence furnished in the steadily accumulating scientific literature is brought to bear on that specific feature. This approach \u2013 that of linking structural features of the atlas maps to the published literature \u2013 also more formally underlies Swanson\u2019s published Foundational Model of Connectivity (FMC), which states as one of its arguments that it is based on evidence not authority.",
        "In many ways, then, by linking our spatial datasets to the published evidence in the literature and citing those previous scientists who have furnished this evidence, we explicitly build upon those findings as we disseminate our own to the next group of readers who, in turn, may build upon what we have reported. This process is akin to the transfer of knowledge of spatial location in Polynesian cultures from one generation to the next in \u201ca never-ending chain\u201d, only the difference is that their transfer is in oral, not written, form. It also echoes the concept of \u2018time-binding\u2019 furnished by Korzybski (1950), as articulated by abstract artists such as Charles Biederman, where succeeding generations of human beings retain and build upon the knowledge and understanding from previous generations of how visualization of complex forms can be achieved (see p. 32\u201333 of). Complex and highly specific forms in art and music often find recurrences in later works, whether it be Greek key motifs in art or guitar riffs in songs (e.g., compare 0:48 of, with 6:19 of); the re-embedding of these motifs in later works simultaneously traces evidentiary trails of their origins while at the same time redefining them for new audiences. Similarly, the linkage in time and space of different datasets explicitly points to recurring structure/function relationships in them; this includes re-contextualization of old datasets in relation to new ones, as we discuss next.",
        "Third, as an example of how data can be updated to fit new models, we note that the data maps in both and were plotted in those studies using older editions of the Brain Maps atlases. Thus, Yao and colleagues used the second edition of the atlas (Brain Maps 2) and Kerman and colleagues used the third edition of the atlas (Brain Maps 3). In the present study, we migrated and re-plotted these datasets to the latest edition of Brain Maps (Brain Maps 4.0). The specific atlas levels Kerman and colleagues mapped their datasets to did not undergo any major change in Brain Maps 4.0, making their migration from the third to the fourth edition simply a carryover of the data into a similar space. In contrast, the migration of the dataset from the second to fourth editions re-contextualized those data. Specifically, where there were minimal subregional parcellations of the lateral hypothalamic zone in the second edition, this region underwent a major re-analysis based on more detailed observations by Swanson of the original Nissl-stained tissue set on which the atlas is based (the editions are all based on the same brain: a single, 315-g male Sprague Dawley rat). These considerations lead us to consider next the importance of data layers in a temporal context.",
        "Much as data layers have been proposed for use by geoscientists to mark chronological events in geospatial datasets (; pp 4, 9\u201311; also see), including real-world geospatial processes (\u2018world-time\u2019; i.e., when the geological process took place) and their records/reported findings (\u2018database-time\u2019; i.e., when the observation regarding the geological process was recorded; again, see), data overlays can provide the same advantages for brain mapping. Similar to what Langran and Chrisman (1993) state in their treatment of time in geospatial datasets, we propose that a similar system should be adopted for registering legacy datasets to current reference spaces, since this form of data migration is important to track and memorialize in terms of \u2018world-time\u2019 and \u2018database-time\u2019. The salient difference between how geological processes and their documentation are handled in this fashion and how we might imagine neurological processes to play out is that the time between the occurrence of a neurological process and its observation is usually never very long. Thus, whereas geological and neurological processes can both occur quickly in real time (e.g., earthquakes, seizures) and measured the moment they occur (e.g., seismographs, electroencephalograms), the former can also occur over the scale of centuries (continental drift, seafloor spreading) and measured accordingly (magnetic field inversions, isotope ratios). As a result, the \u2018database-time\u2019 (time when observations are recorded) can be far apart from \u2018world-time\u2019 of that event.",
        "However, one way in which there are longer time frames in neuroscience (apart from lifespan in one organism or comparisons of lifespans of different organisms or evolutionary processes) is between sets of recorded observations in neuroscientific history. Thus, there is a need to consider that the time between world-time and database-time in experimental neuroscience will usually be short, but model-building will require multiple snapshots in database-time as the spatial model of the brain is further refined. A standardized atlas, which importantly, also ought to undergo revisions over time, can serve as such a model, and spatial mapping such as that presented here can be databased over time and various experimental observations so recorded.",
        "In the case of our simple exemplars of legacy database registration, we propose that a standard notation be used for data migration, and that this notation be included as a tag accompanying a given dataset. Thus, (based on Brain Maps 2) migrated to the current Chemopleth 1.0 database (based on BM4.0) could be written in notation form as the following dataset name: S98 \u2192 S18, where S98 and S18 denote Swanson atlas editions from 1998 and 2018, respectively (as proposed by us earlier:) and the arrow denotes migration between the two atlas editions. We have used this notation for our data layers in Chemopleth 1.0.",
        "In neuroscience, certain fundamental issues associated with the visualization of neural elements in space naturally arose from the desire to examine \u2013 in three dimensions \u2013 information that was present in two-dimensional tissue sections under the microscope. Just as photographers needed to find some way of capturing relief features in flat photographs, scientists sought to refine ways to capture 3-D information from the z-axis of an otherwise xy plane. This was difficult with the first microscopes, which were monocular lenses with limited depths of field. However, these instruments eventually gave way to binocular lenses and stereoscopic views where images arriving at both eyes were merged or superimposed to produce greater depths of field. The invention of the stereoscope by Wheatstone in 1838 catalyzed the development of binocular lenses in microscopes, and Cajal\u2019s manual on color photography describes his use of stereoscopy to visualize the nervous system.",
        "Paralleling this need was the corresponding need to represent and visualize drawn 2-dimensional representations of tissue elements viewed through their depth. This need also grew out of limitations imposed by the finite cache of labels one could employ to visualize tissues under the microscope: \u201cthe gains in brain are mainly in the stain\u201d. Early attempts to address problems of superimposition or composite imaging involved manual reconstructions via semi-transparent overlays of paper (e.g.,). Later, sequential images of different structural information could be viewed simultaneously by taking advantage of film technology (e.g.,), breakthroughs for which allowed multiple photographs on film to be combined into a composite image using optical printing, as pioneered, for example, by Richard Edlund for The Empire Strikes Back (; discussed during 25:25\u201328:03 in; also see). The history of the use of transparent overlays has proven to be elusive in its transition from analog to digital formats (e.g., see). In neuroanatomy, computer graphics applications (\u201ccomputer-assisted neuroanatomy\u201d; see) largely supplanted film technology with digital data overlays, which were applied to neuroscientific data in the 1980s (e.g.,).",
        "The Chemopleth 1.0 database is based on a digital overlay system that is historically embedded within the Ai environment from the time of its early version in 1993 (Adobe Illustrator, version 3.1). The use of this overlay tool within the first release of the graphics files of the Brain Maps atlas makes this rat brain atlas likely the first to utilize digital overlay technology and atlas maps formatted in vector graphics. For this atlas, instantiations of a graphic user interface with digital overlay tools were reported by and. Chemopleth 1.0, in many ways, can be considered as a complementary resource.",
        "Overlays allow for both raster- and vector-format data to be superimposable in the same reference space. Historically, as with geomorphological mapping, usually the raster data are photographs (e.g., aerial photographs), which can be placed in register with points, lines, and areas (polygons), which are all vector data that consist of the user\u2019s superimposable annotations or interpretations of the raster data (e.g., feature labels of the landscape). Here, our photomicrographs of Nissl-stained histological material, and those of the adjacent series of immunolabeled tissues from the same subject, were captured in raster format and placed as data layers, with vector-based maps of parcellations superimposed on the photos of immunolabeled data. The simultaneous visualization of multiple data sets in registration with one another affords the investigator with novel views and juxtapositions to fuel the discovery of new spatial relationships among elements of the visualized datasets.",
        "For the choropleth maps, a decision was made to produce these by first setting provisional boundaries for the open vector graphics representing the brain regions. At the time of this writing, most of the brain regions represented in BM4.0 vector graphics templates are not closed polygons. Therefore, as noted in Section 2.5.2, we first closed these visually apparent vector patterns for the eight levels we analyzed in this dataset. We note in that section how these were provisionally assigned and that future refinements of the Brain Maps reference space will no doubt change these boundaries as more data collection and deliberation takes place. The boundaries, therefore, constitute mapped design features that will undergo revision over time and the density scoring that we performed based on their areal measures are also therefore provisional.",
        "The choropleth and isopleth color patterns we used are consistent with older observations, using monochrome LCD monitors, that darker regions on lighter backgrounds, with dark representing greater abundance, is generally most effective in conveying distribution differences. Color management of data layers in mapping (Brewer, 2016) also informed our decision to use specific color patterns for our maps. Apart from color, we opted for cartographic generalization and, therefore, the sizes of the glyphs and strokes used to represent perikarya and neurites, respectively, are decidedly not to scale.",
        "We sought to capture \u2013\u2013 graphically, within our maps \u2013\u2013 a representation of the variance that occurs when an expert mapper transposes spatial labeling information by eye from the native tissue to the digital atlas map. In our process, by the time the mapper sets out to perform such a task, they have become familiar with the spatial relationships of the landmarks and territories in relation to their datasets. This includes an understanding of the plane of section and orientation of the tissue (what we could consider here to be a \u201ccompass sense\u201d, or sense of direction), and the nearest-neighbor relationships of the cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the tissue in relation to the labeling patterns they are observing within it (what we could consider here to be a local \u201cmap sense\u201d, or sense of location). Thus, when the mapper is setting out to place the labeling patterns within the atlas reference environment, they are already at a stage where the variability in placing such patterns is constrained, where their accuracy in mapping is guided by the bounds imposed by these two senses. The orientation of their vantage point, together with knowledge that they are near the relevant objects in the environment, afford them the correct \u201cfield of view\u201d away from the microscope. This is aided by their canvas already being populated as a digital atlas template, containing silhouettes of the regions appearing in their Nissl-stained tissue. Their initial task, therefore, becomes selecting from the appropriate templates and then choosing the correct general location within a single template to begin transferring labeled patterns based on a study of the Nissl series. In most instances, a simple act of placing a filled circle or traced line over the picture of a cell body or neurite, respectively, within the Adobe Illustrator environment preserves its relationship to another labeled cell body or neurite (also see). In fewer instances, a one-to-one drawn representation of the elements was not attempted for those labeling patterns that were very dense.",
        "Grid-based mapping of the brain can be traced as far back as the invention of the stereotaxic instrument by (also see). notes that a drawing of the brain by Eustachius in the 1550s (but published later in 1714), included a pair of rulers, and is a notable early example of a set of coordinates placed in relation to drawn neuroanatomical features. While grids have been used in brain mapping in various ways since these early efforts, our use of grids is based on a different motivation. Specifically, we sought to establish a conceptual framework for the datasets reported by our laboratory that allowed for the recording of spatial locations in atlas-dependent and -independent formats (i.e., locations referring to specific features or entities versus locations referring to an invariant grid or field; see). This was born from the \u201cneed to compute across spatial territory, not just named variables for territories, because certain [immunoreactivity] patterns cut across known territories and spill into unlabeled portions\u201d (Khan, unpublished laboratory blog post, 21 May 2020). The reasons for such a need can be parsed into several topics, which are dealt with in greater detail below.",
        "Many neurochemical systems in the hypothalamus and zona incerta do not follow along traditional patterns of cytoarchitecture based on Nissl parcellations. Thus, a named cluster of cells that populates the atlas as a \u2018part\u2019 of a catalog of \u2018parts\u2019, which is largely based on Nissl-delimited cytoarchitectural boundaries, fails to consider patterns that traverse these limits. A grid bypasses such constraints by allowing for its named grid zone to represent everything contained within it regardless of whether the patterns fall within or outside of named brain parts. Thus, \u2018extra-connectomic\u2019 information is also represented and accounted for.",
        "Grid maps are a useful means to spatially account for, in a systematized fashion, the locations of labeled elements for neuroanatomical experiments that avoids the complexity of contextualizing location with respect to local features in the tissue, apart from macrolevel landmarks such as white matter tracts or other gross anatomical features. Feature-based maps of the brain have undergone refinements and modifications over their history and are often accompanied by healthy discussion and debate concerning their validity (e.g., debates concerning cortical parcellation and compartmentalization). This is no less true for the hypothalamus and zona incerta, the nomenclature and, indeed, basic organization of which remain vigorous topics of discussion (e.g., Croizier et al., 2015). The advantage of grid-based mapping is that the essential zoning of labeled chemoarchitecture is independent of and indifferent to varying opinions regarding the location, organization and nomenclature of the brain regions within which such chemoarchitecture resides.",
        "That being said, there is always the option of superimposing the grid zones in our database as a digital overlay over feature-based contours for cytoarchitectonic regions, and counting immunoreactive elements within each grid zone, something we find useful as a hybrid approach, where a composite map (see Fig. 11, top row; also Fig. 13) that includes both features and grids allows for information from both to help orient the user to accurately map elements to the appropriate grid zone. This has been carried out in certain early studies of chemoarchitectural density mapping. For example, reported quantitation of perikarya displaying immunoreactivity for the glucocorticoid receptor, where the counts were binned on a grid superimposed over a map of the cytoarchitectural boundaries of the locus coeruleus and paraventicular hypothalamic nucleus in young and aged male rats (see their Fig. 11 on p. 104 and Figs. 14 and 15 on pp. 107\u2013108 of their study, respectively). The main difference in our approach is that the grid zones we use are larger in area and indistinguishable from the areas demarcated by the stereotaxic grid already present within the atlas file in a separate layer.",
        "Thus, the stereotaxic grid, which has traditionally been used to aid neuroscientists in targeting the brain with probes for intracranial chemical or gene-directed manipulations, is now being utilized in this instance to map novel chemoarchitecture. At the same time, such mapping efforts \u2013 calibrated to what is traditionally a targeting system \u2013 automatically renders the newly mapped chemoarchitecture amenable to such targeting once reported to the greater scientific community.",
        "We also pursued the development and use of a grid-based system as a complement to feature-based mapping because there are unique advantages afforded with each method, much as there are for music referenced as standard notation or as tablature (, p. xvi), physical processes described in analytic (i.e., Cartesian) vs. geometric (i.e., Euclidean) notation (; scrub to 8:53\u201310:18), longitude measured by timekeeping or astronomical methods, or programs written in machine vs. assembly vs. compiler languages (, pp. 290\u2013296). In our case, as in all these cases, a key advantage is the larger accessibility and democratization of data reporting that the alternative provides (see also). Specifically, little training is required to use a grid-based system to locate and indeed, even to map, labeled elements of the brain in a standardized way. In fact, apart from a basic understanding of stereotaxic coordinates and the use of a brain atlas, a user of this database could, in principle, map directly onto digital templates of the general atlas section\u2019s outline of the brain, without the patterns of parceled brain regions in view (i.e., with the visibility of that digital overlay or data layer toggled off). Much as creators of music and art do not necessarily require formal training to pursue and successfully create and produce their work and can \u201capproach [the work] conceptually rather than technically\u201d, so, too, can neuroscientists untrained in formal atlas-mapping techniques use grids to localize the general position of their labeled elements in an atlas model of the brain.",
        "Thus, the grid should potentially open the atlas to those in the scientific community who seek to incorporate their datasets into a larger community model being built around the Brain Maps reference atlas framework, but who do not themselves have the time and/or expertise to rigorously map their labeled elements in the tissue to the underlying cytoarchitecture. At this stage, we do not expect any but the most discerning or motivated of community members to use what we provide here to begin such a process, but also consider this as but a starting point of establishing a more accessible platform where neuroscientists can physically map their own data to the Brain Maps atlas and thereby contribute to a larger body of work that models structure-function relationships for the brain in a shareable and registrable manner.",
        "The benefits of such democratization are potentially numerous. For one thing, scientists who have expert training in neuroanatomical techniques outside of mapping, particularly in performing intracranial probe placements, central injections, tract-tracing, viral vector delivery, microdialysis, optogenetics, etc., can now use a relatively straightforward means to map, at a coarse resolution of the 1.0 mm \u00d7 1.0 mm stereotaxic grid, the locations of their probe placements. Usually, the practice of reporting stereotaxic coordinates has been to state in the Methods section of papers those coordinates being used to target a previously defined set of features, not necessarily to report the location of new features. If this practice gains currency \u2013 that is, of using grids to map in addition to target \u2013 then, suddenly, all probe locations mapped to grid zones by non-expert mappers can be \u201cbrought into\u201d the spatial model of atlas reference space and juxtaposed with finer neuroanatomical features mapped by experts. We envision some form of content curation where tiers of quality are assigned to datasets from non-experts vs. experts, and that the system must include lessons learned from similar digital resources who have identified their challenges and best practices, such as the Encyclopedia of Life Project. Additionally, the use of this reporting structure (i.e., the grid-based FMRS; see Section 3.5.4.2) can be envisioned to serve the needs of those performing microdissections or finer samplings of brain tissue from experimental subjects (e.g., laser-capture microdissection). FMRS annotations can help anchor dissected samples of tissue and their attendant genomic metadata to fixed locations in atlas reference space by grid zone. Such approaches allow for the alignment of genomic information with neuroanatomic information in a more precise way.",
        "Below, we note some paths forward for possible future iterations of this resource.",
        "Colors could in the future be palletized for the user\u2019s specific needs, or a code of colors could universally signify a set of semiotic meanings for the grids or isopleths, producing an essential visual grammar for grids akin to Piet Mondrian\u2019s color palettes (Mondiran, 1987). In principle, perikarya marked on our maps by a circle glyph could also be color-coded based on cell size and analyzed for spatial patterns, as has been performed for perikarya in the cat and monkey cortex to reveal novel substructure in cytoarchitectonic patterns. Our grid-based visualizations could, in principle, also encode more information by alterations in the appearance of individual tiles, much as Vasarely\u2019s paintings so brilliantly achieve (e.g., see, \u2018Supernovae\u2018), or modify the actual parameters of the grids themselves to create depth in digital overlay space, as so adroitly achieved in other media, such as that found in the works of Christiane Feser (see, \u2018Felder 3 (Field 3)\u2019) or Charles Biederman (see, \u2018Work No. 3, New York, 1939\u2019).",
        "There is intriguing evidence that grids in maps facilitate greater recall of features embedded in maps. It would be interesting to see if this observation holds true for maps of cytoarchitecture, and a test of such a hypothesis could be conducted within a teaching laboratory setting. Work performed in our Brain Mapping & Connectomics teaching laboratory for freshman undergraduates suggests that it could be an ideal setting for such a hypothesis to be tested by student volunteers, a possibility we are now exploring. Grid overlays could also be used to bring separate mapped elements into register in a manner that minimizes specific mapping errors arising from differences in resolution between the elements or from roundoff errors generated by disparities between algorithms and finite-precision mathematical operations, as has been demonstrated in geographic information systems. The overall extent of error in mapping using digital systems, more generally, has been a subject of much discussion in cartography (e.g.,) and future work will help formalize the sources of error for atlas-based transfer of anatomical information from photomicrographs of histologically processed tissue sections (see the cogent discussion of this topic by). Aggregation of such data in the form of spatially averaged choropleth and isopleth maps merit additional considerations of error (e.g.,) which require further exploration for atlas-based mapping.",
        "Mapping the spatial organization of cells and fibers in the brain is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Now in its fourth edition, the Brain Maps atlas provides a rigorous anatomical reference for the rat brain and is a valuable resource for the neuroscience community, alongside other excellent brain atlases for the rat (e.g., Paxinos & Watson, 2014; Kleven et al., 2023), which have been placed in basic register with the Brain Maps framework.",
        "In this draft report, we have provided a description of a forthcoming spatial database, called Chemopleth 1.0, which will furnish freely accessible Brain Maps 4.0 digital atlas maps of five neurochemical systems in the rat hypothalamus and zona incerta (>1840) brain regions critically involved in controlling many survival functions. Our efforts to create a spatial database at mesoscale resolution complements efforts to create databases at macroscales based on standardized brain atlases (e.g.,; also see) and are meant to be used for the same purpose as they are, particularly with respect to stereotaxic targeting (e.g., see). The work also complements efforts for mouse brain to create interactive frameworks to synergize disparate datasets at cellular resolution.",
        "Ultimately, we envision future numbered versions of Chemopleth 1.0 will: (1) contain greater amounts of chemoarchitectural data registered to our existing collection of mapped datasets; (2) incorporate more registered legacy datasets from the published literature; and (3) include Brain Maps base maps that are created for revised versions of the core atlas. Apart from these naturally progressing improvements, we are eyeing the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape for geospatial/archaeological analysis (e.g., the newly emerging field of GeoAI; see; see for archaeological application) to help develop workflows that allow diverse spatial locations of corresponding space on digital overlays to be analyzed for cause-effect biological relationships and inferences drawn about possible interactions, as conceptualized over a decade ago by our laboratory (, Fig. 8). This will allow for multiscale integration of experimental metadata and would address some issues plaguing top-down and bottom-up approaches. They will also bring quickly to the fore the larger challenge of making sense of all spatially registered data within one mapped location, finally shifting our attention in neuroanatomy from data gathering to data intelligence, as we finally \u201cface the mother lode\u201d: evidence collected from communal data, and finally organized as shared information, waiting to be harnessed for medical treatments, drug discovery, multiscale views of the nervous system, and ultimately, a deeper view of ourselves."
