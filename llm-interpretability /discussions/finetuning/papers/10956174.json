        " Panel description ",
        "Despite global progress in reducing preventable maternal and newborn deaths, high rates of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality continue, mainly due to poor quality of care. Additional transformational and catalytic approaches are needed to provide high-quality respectful patient-centered care to further improve maternal and newborn well-being and survival. One documented successful approach is Networks of Care (NoC).",
        "NoC are an innovative approach to optimize health system functioning, intentionally creating and strengthening health system relationships to support transformational change in maternal and newborn health. NoC emphasize relational elements, such as empowered multidisciplinary teams, respect, teamwork, trust, communication, collaboration, leadership, and supportive supervision and mentorship, which differentiate it from other health systems strengthening approaches. Functional NoC enable collaborative learning and coordinated continuity of respectful and quality care to optimize linkages for efficient and resilient health systems, and to ultimately improve maternal and newborn survival and well-being. Future opportunities include scaling up the NoC approach at national and sub-national levels and addressing gaps in the evidence base.",
        "The NoC approach has been implemented in many contexts. This panel will provide an overview of the NoC approach, and highlight examples and results of NoC from three countries: Kenya (Makueni County), Nepal (One Heart Worldwide), and Zambia (integrated sexual, reproductive, maternal, and newborn health program).",

        " Background ",
        "Although improvements made in maternal and newborn health (MNH) have increased maternal and neonatal survival in Nepal, challenges remain for the country to reach Stage V of the obstetric transition. The international nongovernmental organization One Heart Worldwide (OHW) supports the Government of Nepal\u2019s national plan to provide quality MNH services to pregnant women and their newborns living in rural areas. In collaboration with all levels of the health system, OHW forms Networks of Safety (NoS) to provide quality MNH care in some of Nepal\u2019s most remote and difficult-to-access geographies. These NoS are examples of Networks of Care (NoC). All NoS exhibit core system-strengthening NoC functional elements, such as constructing new birthing centers and providing equipment, along with relational elements such as promoting local ownership, supporting mentorship, and connecting providers from the community level through to tertiary care.",
        " Methods ",
        "NoS build local capacity through a participatory model and target infrastructure, local leadership, and local communities over a six-year period. Many network activities are co-financed by the municipalities leveraging a financially sustainable adoption-at-scale solution that addresses the systemic health care access disparities disproportionately affecting mothers and newborns in last-mile environments. NoS also spearhead innovative approaches such as a simulation-based mentorship program to maintain essential clinical skills among rural health care providers and an MNH helpline that supports these providers in clinical decision-making, particularly in emergencies.",
        " Results ",
        "In 2022, OHW\u2019s NoS have been expanded to 28 districts across Nepal, reaching a third of districts in the country. As of today, OHW is implementing NoS in 20 districts, covering a population of 6.6 million with 165,000 annual pregnancies, and has completed the program in eight districts. Since 2010, the NoS have improved quality MNH care for more than 414,000 pregnancies in rural Nepal.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "OHW\u2019s work shows how NoC are a sustainable approach to provide quality care for MNH in remote and rural areas through innovative strategies and solutions. We will continue to scale and adapt network interventions to ensure access and quality of MNH care and plan to reach 50% of districts by 2030.",

        "The United States (U.S.) is experiencing a maternal health crisis. To meet Sustainable Development Goals, many countries are working to decrease their maternal mortality ratios (MMR), currently achieving a 38% global decrease between 2000 and 2017. However, the U.S. continues to report a significant MMR increase and racial inequities with Black women dying at nearly three times the rate of white women. Black birthing women are also twice as likely as white women to experience severe pregnancy complications.",
        "The Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA), founded in 2016, serves as a national voice and coordinating entity for stakeholders advancing Black maternal health, rights, and justice. We envision a world where Black Mamas have the rights, respect, and resources to thrive before, during, and after pregnancy. BMMA believes that community empowerment and mobilization are vital to its strategy to involve small-scale organizations, health workers, and everyday citizens interacting to increase education and engagement in preventive health promotion activities. Our approach utilizes the strengths of doulas, midwives, and other skilled maternal health actors working with the communities they serve.",
        "This panel will provide an overview of BMMA; the work conducted within our four key pillars of policy, research, care, and culture shift; and the impact on maternal health in the U.S. Speakers will describe BMMA\u2019s process for leveraging Black women\u2019s lived experiences and scholarship to decolonize research, develop policy priorities, identify principles for holistic maternity care, and apply BMMA\u2019s research principles across a variety of projects addressing Black maternal health.",

        "Black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women in the United States (U.S.). Yet, research to understand the underlying causes of the inequities have historically marginalized and neglected Black birthing people. The Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA), a national network of Black women-led organizations and professionals, developed best practices for conducting research with, for, and by Black Mamas to redefine how research can, and should, be done in the U.S. to improve Black maternal health outcomes.",
        " Methods ",
        "Since 2017, BMMA has been applying its research principles to projects dedicated to addressing inequities in maternal health in the U.S. Two such projects include research examining the role of disrespectful maternity care among Black women in Atlanta, Georgia, and increasing community engagement efforts within state and local maternal mortality review processes. Key activities have included centering community needs, voices, and experts to lead the research; utilizing its alliance structure to uplift Black researchers; instituting regular feedback loops with communities participating in the research; and prioritizing communities in the dissemination of results.",
        " Results ",
        "Applying these research principles has enabled BMMA to be responsive to community needs and embrace communities as equal partners in the conduct of research. Key results include elevating the voices of Black birthing people to share their experiences with disrespectful maternity care; empowering communities most affected to provide direct feedback to government entities and funders who have dictated how maternal mortality reviews should be done; and centering community-driven, innovative approaches to improving maternal health in the U.S.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "BMMA\u2019s research principles have led to a paradigm shift in how research is done with, for, and by Black Mamas. Application of the principles has transformed the ways in which research and programming around maternal health have traditionally been done in the U.S. by shifting decision-making power and ownership to communities that know best what they need. It has reframed the narrative of Black maternal health from that of deficit to asset-based thinking whereby the communities most affected have the expertise and solutions to fully address inequities in maternal health.",

        " Background ",
        "The United States (U.S.) is experiencing a maternal health crisis with maternal mortality ratios increasing over the last 20 years and disproportionately affecting Black women who are dying from largely preventable causes at three times the rate of white women. Addressing this crisis requires maternal health care, policy, and research that is led by the group most affected but often left out of solution creation, Black birthing people. Recognizing this equity, the Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA) created working groups that use strategies grounded in Black birthing people\u2019s lived experience, wisdom, and leadership to advance care, change policy, and cultivate research. These working groups created principles and priorities that the perinatal workforce, researchers, advocates, funders, and other stakeholders can use as guiding posts to combat maternal mortality and collectively achieve Black maternal health, rights, and justice.",
        " Methods ",
        "Between 2017 and 2019, BMMA convened alliance partners who are leading experts in maternal and reproductive health and created three working groups: Holistic Care, Policy, and Research. The working groups consisted of Black perinatal professionals, research scholars, policy professionals, and advocates. The groups assessed the current landscape of maternal, sexual, and reproductive health care, policy, and research, and identified gaps.",
        " Results ",
        "Principles were created for achieving holistic maternity care, engaging in equitable research with Black communities, and advancing policy priorities grounded in frameworks around reproductive justice and human rights to improve Black maternal health outcomes. Each working group published a report with historical background and framing of the current public health problem that is the maternal mortality crisis among Black birthing people with a set of principles and priorities for widespread use.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The holistic care and research principles and policy priorities created by BMMA take a multi-pronged approach to equipping the perinatal workforce, researchers, advocates, funders, and other stakeholders with the tools and guidelines to collectively support Black Mamas and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. These principles and priorities are leading the way in a paradigm shift that highlights the expertise Black scholars and the perinatal workforce possess, while supporting and centering Black Mamas in care, policy, and research practices and decisions in the U.S. and globally.",

The alliance is made up of 40 community-based organizations and 25 individual collaborators.",
        " Methods ",
        "BMMA approaches our work through four pillars: policy, research, care, and culture shift. We introduce and advance policy grounded in the human rights framework that addresses Black maternal health inequity and improves Black maternal health outcomes [Policy]; leverage talent and knowledge that exist in Black communities and cultivate innovative research methods to generate the evidence base for Black maternal health and inform the policy agenda to improve Black maternal health [Research]; promote holistic and comprehensive care for better outcomes for Black women, their children, families, and ultimately their communities [Care]; and redirect and reframe conversations on Black maternal health and amplify the voices of Black Mamas [Culture Shift].",
        " Results ",
        "BMMA has made significant progress in advancing Black maternal health, rights, and justice in the United States. In 2018, BMMA founded the national Black Maternal Health Week, which led to the White House marking the first-ever federal Maternal Health Day of Action in 2021. BMMA also founded the Black Maternal Health Conference and Training Institute with more than 1,000 attendees in 2022. BMMA provides opportunities for professionals to gain continuing education credits and increase knowledge, skills, and competencies in Black maternal health through trainings and webinars. We convened our partners around strategic topic areas and created working groups, fellowships, and publications across our four focus areas.",

Yet, the midwifery workforce is in crisis. There is an estimated global shortage of 900,000 midwives due to fewer intakes into educational institutions; inadequate investment in recruitment, deployment, and remuneration; and a weak supportive environment.",
        "White Ribbon Alliance (WRA) pioneered an innovative programmatic approach that both increases political will to invest in midwives and accelerates national policy change, all in accordance with midwives\u2019 priorities. Midwives\u2019 Voices, Midwives\u2019 Demands (MVMD) is a groundbreaking campaign launched in 2021 by WRA, the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), and partners. The campaign was based on an open-ended question: \u201cWhat do you want most in your role as a midwife?\u201d WRA and ICM selected nine focus countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe for intensive outreach. Trained mobilizers queried health care providers and recorded responses using the What Women Want Chatbot\u2014a novel digital tool that uses WhatsApp and artificial intelligence to rapidly capture demands and analyze results. Responses from non-focus countries were collected via an e-survey.",
        "MVMD reached 56,000+ midwives in 100 countries. The two largest demands were for more and better-supported personnel, including increased salaries, and for supplies and functional facilities. This panel will explore how campaign partners have used the MVMD process and results to strengthen midwifery policy development and implementation in their countries, creating a more conducive environment based on what midwives say.",

        "The Nurse Practitioner in Midwifery (NPM) is a new cadre launched by the Government of India (GoI) in 2018. Rollout of NPMs at the national and state levels was significantly stymied due to COVID-19. The Midwives\u2019 Voices, Midwives\u2019 Demands (MVMD) campaign refocused attention on midwives, mobilizing more than 10,000 responses nationwide from NPMs and other cadres providing maternal and newborn health services. Top asks included better facilities and adequate supplies, more staffing and better remuneration, better respect and recognition of the role, and improved autonomy and gender norms.",
        " Methods ",
        "Following the mobilization effort, in 2022, the Centre for Catalyzing Change/White Ribbon Alliance India (WRAI) implemented strategic advocacy activities to disseminate MVMD findings and support midwifery research and action agendas. For example, WRA India developed a Charter of Demands with a Call to Action to maternal health experts at the national and state levels, and disseminated campaign findings with midwifery multi-stakeholders in consultations and convenings. WRA India also brought midwives\u2019 demands to technical discussions on implementation research and practice and launched a communications campaign to mobilize policy and programmatic support for their demands.",
        " Results ",
        "The MVMD campaign helped fortify government efforts to integrate midwifery-led care in India\u2019s public health system, with demands being particularly useful in supporting implementation of new policies. For example, in June 2021, the GoI launched a first-ever Scope of Practice for midwives. Although the scope of practice has been rolled out, awareness and understanding among practitioners have been uneven. WRA India used its MVMD Call to Action\u2014which elevates midwives\u2019 demands for better recognition of their role and increased autonomy\u2014to socialize the scope of practice and call for empowering midwives to legally practice to their full scope. WRA India is now working with State Nursing Councils on additional licensure needed for midwifery practice that includes the full scope of practice.",

        "Midwifery is at an inflection point in Pakistan. The country faces an eight-fold shortage of midwives, and the Community Midwives (CMWs) program has not been as successful as envisaged. The federal government, in response, has embarked on developing a new National Vision and Strategic Framework for Midwifery (Strategic Framework). At the same time, Forum for Safe Motherhood (FSM) launched its Midwives\u2019 Voices, Midwives\u2019 Demands campaign (MVMD). FSM heard from 6,145 midwives from across Pakistan including CMWs, Nurses, and Lady Health Visitors. More and better-supported personnel emerged as the top request.",
        " Methods ",
        "To shape and align the Strategic Framework with midwives\u2019 priorities, FSM first performed a deeper analysis of campaign demands, examining the geography and cadre. FSM augmented this analysis with midwives\u2019 personal testimonials, especially those of CMWs, to further characterize their challenges and solutions for change. Next, FSM shared MVMD findings and stories with all key stakeholders from the public and private sectors. To build additional buy-in, especially for policy implementation, FSM and partners organized provincial and regional consultative sessions across Pakistan with major academic institutions, provincial departments of health, and directorates of nursing.",
        " Results ",
        "MVMD campaign demands not only influenced the architecture of the Strategic Framework, but also shaped the policy actions contained therein. The largest asks from midwives, especially from CMWs, were for government jobs, better support and pay, and a career pathway\u2014all of which were incorporated. Specifically, the Strategic Framework calls for regularization and creation of vacancies for midwives in the government health system; proper policy implementation of the pay scale, with time-scale promotion, remuneration, and upgradation with additional qualification; and development of a proper career ladder, job description, and monitoring mechanisms for midwives.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "MVMD brought invaluable field evidence to policy discussions and compelled decision-makers to craft policy actions that responded directly to midwives\u2019 concerns. It also enabled decision-makers to consider the perspectives of those rarely heard, such as CMWs working in rural and remote areas. In addition to guiding the national vision, the Strategic Framework will now serve as a roadmap for provincial midwifery strategies and midwives\u2019 perspectives will once again serve as the evidence for action.",

As part of the Midwives\u2019 Voices, Midwives\u2019 Demands (MVMD) campaign, White Ribbon Alliance (WRA) Kenya captured the perspectives of more than 3,500 midwives across the country, with top asks related to supplies, increased salaries, and more staff. The campaign coincided with the national government\u2019s push to develop a new national policy on nursing and midwifery, presenting an opportunity to infuse midwives\u2019 priorities.",
        " Methods ",
        "In 2021, prior to the launch of MVMD, WRA Kenya implemented a listening exercise with midwives in the Lake Region counties. The challenges they surfaced\u2014shortage of midwives, lack of equipment and supplies, and absence of career pathways\u2014were a harbinger of the MVMD findings to come. WRA Kenya shared these findings with decision-makers to inform early drafts of the national policy. WRA Kenya also organized workshops with MVMD participants to strategize and develop collective advocacy strategies. Several of these midwives were influential members of the taskforce that developed the national policy. Finally, as the national policy was being readied, WRA Kenya partnered with the Midwives Association of Kenya to host a national roundtable with 150 stakeholders and disseminate MVMD results.",
        " Results ",
        "In May 2022, the Kenyan Government launched its first-ever National Nursing and Midwifery Policy recognizing midwifery in Kenya as an independent profession. The policy responds directly to the needs of midwives, calling for strengthened education, better remuneration, increased supplies and facility-level investments to enable midwives to deliver quality care, and professional development pathways for the midwifery workforce. MVMD, moreover, helped accelerate other policy outcomes including an expanded scope of practice for midwives and positive governance changes in the professional midwives\u2019 association.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Although many actors contributed to midwifery policy action in Kenya, MVMD has proven to be both insightful and catalytic. The campaign also supported and emboldened midwives to self-advocate at decision-making tables and witness uptake of their voices in policy. The launch of this policy serves as an important first step to lay a foundation toward a sustainable future for the profession.",

Providing safe oxygen and effective pressures to newborns with respiratory distress and pneumonia is critical to providing quality care to 30 million newborns requiring inpatient care each year. The World Health Organization\u2019s Standards call for specific medical equipment appropriate for SSNC. In response, global innovators have designed equipment for respiratory support that provides effective pressure generation, blended oxygen, and oxygen saturation monitoring to prevent oxygen toxicity in premature newborns.",

In low-resource settings the cost and logistics of providing the required levels of oxygen and air must be factored into equipment provision. A 6,000 litre oxygen cylinder may need to be replaced more than once a day, resulting in prohibitively high lifetime costs.",
        "The requirements for appropriate CPAP are: adequate flowrates of both oxygen and air; stable controlled pressure reflected at the patient interface; independence between flowrate and pressure; and minimal imposed work of breathing (iWOB). Warming and humidification of the gases is also an established benefit to help avoid septum necrosis, nasal obstruction, and hypothermia.",

Diamedica (UK) Ltd utilized this base technology to develop a CPAP device that would deliver all the required elements of effective neonatal CPAP at lower running costs, namely the cost of electricity to run the concentrator. A novel design approach utilized the concentrator compressor to provide controlled flows of oxygen and air, warmed and humidified using waste heat from the concentrator. Two models were developed, providing either 5 or 10 L/min each of both oxygen and air, the full range of FiO2 is controllable. Everything required to deliver CPAP is provided in a single mobile unit, facilitating ease of setup and use. Voltage stabilization is supplied as standard, with optional battery backup.",

A large number of bCPAPs in low- and middle-income countries do not have blenders or routine access to electricity and are relying exclusively on 100% O2; 2. Use of 100% oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity, which can result in retinopathy of prematurity or chronic lung disease; and 3. Without gradual data to drive prioritization of updating respiratory guidelines, demand for investments in innovative safe delivery of oxygen, and continued creative solutions, neonates may continue to receive unsafe oxygen delivery.",

        "The reduction of maternal mortality has long been a global health priority and remains a prominent part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda. The SDGs include a direct emphasis on reducing maternal mortality, while also highlighting the importance of moving beyond survival. SDG target 3.1\u2014to reduce global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030\u2014is an ambitious target and will require sustained commitments to ensure that women and adolescent girls get quality care and support when and where needed.",
        "The United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Interagency Group, comprising the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division, has collaborated with external academic teams and technical experts on a new round of maternal mortality estimates covering the period 2000\u20132020. These new MMR estimates supersede all previous estimates and are based on the most up-to-date data and methods, assessing national, regional, and global trends monitoring progress toward 2030. The panel will also report updated causes of maternal death estimates from WHO.",
        "Having targets for maternal mortality reduction is important; however, accurate data remain the key to robust policy and programming. Authors from Sri Lanka and Jamaica will share data and processes to quantify and reduce missed and misclassified maternal deaths. Enhanced reporting will allow better data use, informing maternal cause of death attribution, relevant interventions, and tracking including interpretation of the gaps in coverage.",

        " Background ",
        "Sri Lanka is a lower middle-income country with low maternal mortality, and is considered a success story in terms of both reducing maternal mortality and improving its measurement. Sri Lanka has an established history of maternal death monitoring. The MDSR system was started in 1959, with the notification of probable maternal deaths being made mandatory in 1985. A decade later, a structured review of probable maternal deaths was initiated, and a national database has been in place since 2000.",
        " Methods ",
        "Mandatory death notification in Sri Lanka is a key strength of the MDSR system in ensuring high levels of completeness. This presentation will describe the steps and characteristics of the system, and how these features strengthen reporting and improve outcomes. For example, postmortems must be sought for all probable maternal deaths to confirm pregnancy or recent delivery or pregnancy loss/termination among women of reproductive age, contributing to delineating pathology and more accurately determining the cause of death. In addition, Sri Lanka also uses community health workers (field public health midwives) to notify of any potential maternal deaths that took place both inside and outside of health care facilities, minimizing the potential for underreporting.",
        " Results ",
        "The surveillance process in Sri Lanka has a clear and established \u201cno name, no blame\u201d policy at all stages. This assurance of confidentiality helps to give confidence in accurate reporting without the fear of repercussions or reprisals, ensuring that appropriate, evidence based actions can then be taken to make improvements. One challenge for the system has been a time lag between the notification of the death and the availability of review outcomes, which are needed for decision-making. To help to address this issue, the Ministry of Health has introduced an immediate response system, whereby the Director General of Health Services (the highest level administrator) convenes a fact-finding discussion with all caregivers in cases where service gaps have been identified.",

        "Reliable data systems are critical to monitoring survival for rare conditions like maternal deaths, given that small variations impact measurement accuracy. In 1998, Jamaica established an active maternal mortality surveillance system (MMS) and added death certification to the medical curriculum; however, between 1998\u20132007, just 126/428 (29%) of maternal deaths appeared in vital registration statistics. A pregnancy checkbox was added to the medical certificate of cause of death in 2014. We aim to determine if these interventions have improved retrieval of maternal deaths from vital registration.",
        " Methods ",
        "Vital registration data for 2018\u20132021 were triangulated with MMS information to determine completeness.",
        " Results ",
        "Of 227 maternal deaths identified for 2018\u20132021, 62% (n=140) were registered as maternal deaths, including 24 (11%) missed by MMS. The MMS accounted for 80% (n=183) of cases, with 51% (n=126) common to both sources. Another 16% (n=37) were registered, but misclassified as non-maternal deaths, and 13% (n=30) were not registered. Misclassification included both inflation due to certification of late maternal deaths as maternal deaths, and under-reporting, with true maternal deaths missed because of certification/coding errors, and non-registration. In 2021, 43% of maternal deaths were due to COVID-19 (cause-specific MR=115; total maternal mortality ratio=258/100,000); and two-thirds of COVID-19 cases were misclassified.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The pregnancy checkbox has improved maternal mortality case identification through vital registration from 29% to 70% in 15 years; however, gaps remain related to non-registration of community maternal deaths/coroner\u2019s cases. Certification/coding of indirect maternal deaths should reflect the changing disease profile of antenatal women, including their susceptibility to infections such as COVID-19. Global reporting should reflect these risks alongside the traditional direct complications of pregnancy.",

        " Results ",
        "We included data from 142 countries and 950 country years. Globally, the most common cause of maternal death was hemorrhage (26%; 80% uncertainty interval [UI]: 22%\u201330%), followed by indirect obstetric deaths (23%, 80% UI: 19%\u201329%), and hypertension (16%; 80% UI: 14%\u201319%). There was substantial regional variation in the proportion of deaths due to hemorrhage. Data on maternal suicide and late maternal deaths were very inconsistently reported. Few countries reported deaths due to maternal suicide in developed regions, with only five countries had data recording one or more maternal suicide deaths. In low- and middle-income regions, we estimated between 3%\u20138% of maternal deaths were due to suicide The ratio of late maternal deaths to maternal deaths up to 42 days was 0 to 0.1 among those countries that reported at least one such death.",
        " Conclusions ",

This update includes for the first time an analysis attempting to report on maternal suicide as a cause of death. Hemorrhage remains the leading individual cause of death, despite the existence of effective clinical interventions.

Analyzed data included deliveries, live births, maternal, perinatal, and newborn deaths from January 2019 to June 2020.",
        " Results ",
        "Within the perinatal mortality rate of 32/1,000 total births, neonatal deaths within the first week (0\u20137 days) was the majority (80%). Stillbirths were 58% antepartum and 42% intrapartum, respectively. After completion of the MPDSR skills workshops, 20 recommendations were developed from June 2019 to June 2020. At the time of data analysis, 65% (13 of 20) were completed, 15% (three of 20) were in progress and 20% (four of 20) were delayed. Of the recommendations, 60% (12 of 20) related to reducing perinatal deaths. In the first six months of the MPDSR program, the perinatal mortality rate increased (27 to 35/1,000) but maternal mortality decreased (366 to 139/10,000). For the perinatal deaths, this finding suggests that the surveillance and reporting of stillborn and newborn deaths increased after the MPDSR skills workshop.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This is the first study in northeast Namibia to document implications of a functional MPDSR approach in reducing newborn deaths. The first week of life is when a majority of newborn deaths occur. Unless quality of care is improved, and evidence- based strategic interventions implemented during labor, childbirth and immediate postnatal care period, preventable perinatal deaths will not decrease. Improved knowledge and skills by the MPDSR team on what, how, and why capture certain variables, calculation of proportions, ratios and rates played a crucial role in data quality improvement. Results confirm that skills building before introducing or strengthening the MPDSR system is crucial.",

        "Understanding implementation of maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is critical for scaling up and strengthening the intervention process. Few countries report robust operational systems at scale in Africa. One exception is South Africa, which has been implementing a perinatal audit program, a form of MPDSR, to capture perinatal mortality, identify modifiable factors, and motivate change through a quality-of-care audit cycle. This study explores the history of initiating, scaling up, and institutionalizing this program in South Africa.",

        "Multiple factors influence institutionalization of an audit program, including tangible factors, such as focal points, policies and tools, as well as the societal and systems factors, such as actor interactions and motivations, political priority, and adaption. For South Africa, the national and subnational structures evolved over time and interacted to support implementation benefiting from a continuity of actors, who were able to expand and nurture the network. The perinatal audit program was integrated into national policy and guidelines until recently. Intentional and continuous efforts to demonstrate the impact and enable local adaption allowed for more ownership and buy-in during all phases of implementation. Stagnating mortality reduction along with declining coverage of deliveries reported through the program in recent year\u2019s signaled that backsliding is possible without continuous effort to support implementation.",

Studying perinatal death surveillance and response (PDSR) implementation can lead to continuous quality improvement and greater accountability in MNH. A recent scoping review of PDSR studies found that the use of implementation frameworks leads to more insightful findings that can better guide policy and health systems recommendations.

The desk review revealed that the inner setting (local clinics and hospitals) and outer settings (regional organizations and nongovernmental organizations) worked cohesively to implement infrastructural improvements and human resource capacity-building needed to enhance maternal and perinatal quality of care. Their interwoven structure allowed the completion of comprehensive audit reviews to assess maternal and perinatal deaths and near-miss cases. Competing priorities of the providers involved in MNH care, insufficient local human and technical resources, and the persistence of paper-based records were identified as major barriers to routine implementation of PDSR.

In Exemplar countries with particularly sharp fertility declines, such as Bangladesh, decreases in fertility were found to respectively contribute toward 44% and 47% of MMR and NMR reductions. Access to modern contraception, female education, delayed age at first marriage, declining NMR itself, and broadly evolving views about the role of women in society all influenced fertility rates.

The current framework and indicators have provided critical information to help develop data-driven approaches to reducing maternal mortality and set targets and track progress toward strengthening EmOC services. At the same time, health systems have evolved, the evidence base has expanded, and implementation lessons have been collected about what works and what remains challenging across different settings. With these developments in mind, a global initiative led by Columbia University\u2019s Averting Maternal Death and Disability program, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO is updating, improving, and expanding the EmOC framework and indicators to better meet the needs of countries for the next 20 years. This process has been designed using principles and practices of human centered design to ensure that the indicators meet the needs of key users, particularly national and subnational planners and managers. This includes learning from countries\u2019 experiences using the EmONC framework and indicators and their ideas for improvement. A global modified Delphi study and in-depth studies in Senegal, Malawi, and Bangladesh using human-centered design methods generated insights on what is needed and wanted for planning and monitoring implementation.

From the obstetrician\u2019s perspective, there are challenges in operationalizing iKMC. These include initiating KMC in the labor room, ensuring transportation in the KMC position, creating a mother-and-baby-friendly infrastructure in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) known as Mother Newborn Care Unit (MNCU)and ensuring coordination with the pediatrics team for providing postnatal care to mothers in the NICU.",

        "Facility-initiated kangaroo mother care (KMC) for stable low birthweight (LBW) infants is a proven high-impact intervention to reduce mortality. However, many LBW infants die before stabilization and the coverage of KMC is low globally. The World Health Organization (WHO)-led research has proved that initiating immediate KMC soon after birth (iKMC) before stabilization is a promising strategy to improve coverage, in addition to developing context-adapted implementation models. There is a need to understand how to scale up iKMC in LMCIs.",

        "In the transition model, the median level of institutional deliveries increased from 42% to 98% as countries moved from high mortality (phase I) to low mortality (phase V). Wealth-related inequalities in institutional delivery decreased strongly. The transition from phase I to II often involved increases in number of births in lower-level health facilities, while subsequent progress was characterized by rapid increases in hospital births. Median cesarean section rates increased from <1% to 17% among the poorest quintile (phase I to phase IV).",
        "Exemplar countries increased institutional delivery over time, often dramatically (e.g., 9% to 78% in Nepal). Moreover, countries with the highest mortality levels in 2017 (e.g., Niger phase II) had low institutional deliveries (30%), hospital deliveries (0.4%), and cesarean section rates among the poorest quintile (0.5%). The reverse occurred for low mortality countries. Morocco (phase IV) had the highest institutional (86%) and hospital deliveries (57%) and cesarean section among the poorest quintile (13%). Hospital facilities matter because the proportion able to provide comprehensive emergency care was higher than the proportion of lower-level facilities able to provide basic emergency care.

Trends were analyzed calculating the annual average rate of change (AARC). Patterns of inequality were evaluated, and absolute measures of inequality were calculated by area of residence using the urban-rural gap, and by wealth quintiles using the slope index of inequality (SII).",

        "The median MNH score in the latest surveys from exemplar countries was 1.85, ranging from 1.07 in Morocco 2003 to 2.26 in Nepal 2019. The median MNH score gap was 0.56 in favor of urban areas, with the widest and narrowest gaps observed in Morocco (0.85 points) and India (0.24 points), respectively. Trend analyses showed that the urban-rural gaps are closing, with the largest reduction observed in India (\u22129.8% AARC). Regarding wealth quintiles, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal, and Niger went from a top to a linear pattern of inequality, while India and Senegal changed from a linear to an approximately bottom pattern of inequality. Although MNH scores increased over the years in all wealth quintiles, SII estimates showed that the gaps between the top and bottom of the wealth distribution, comparing the first and latest surveys, decreased only in India (from 2.47 to 0.72), Nepal (1.79 to 1.22), and Niger (1.27 to 0.89).",

        "The process of the Ministry of Health and partners involved ensuring governance structures and functional technical working groups were in place for QoC measurement in all learning districts and facilities to ensure a growing culture of data use. Further, the team developed and refined a minimum set of quality indicators; adapted and developed district and facility data collection tools to capture essential data on the new indicators; ensured the reporting systems for facility, district, and national levels captured the new indicators; and developed a QoC indicator dashboard, which is integrated in the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2). The MNCH QoC indicators in Sierra Leone were integrated in the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health scorecard, and the country team developed a maternal death surveillance and response line listing, perinatal death surveillance and response line listing, and child death audit line listing tool to document health facility deaths. The audit line listing tool is integrated in the DHIS2, and efforts are underway to integrate the pediatric death audit line listing tool. The country team also hired a new cadre of committed district and hospital QoC Officers and strengthened their capacity to analyze and communicate quality indicators. Further data quality audits through periodic supportive supervision took place.

Women describe how they are not listened to or believed when sharing concerns with their medical provider, and in turn do not feel valued or respected. While there has been much focus on supporting providers to deliver effective care, there has been less focus on the experience of care by the mothers themselves and the impact of the care they receive, the manner in which care is delivered, and the environment in which it is delivered. Designing a better care experience starts with asking mothers \u201cwhat matters to you?\u201d but their answers need to be turned into action. Those answers can drive the way facilities are designed, choice of care, and how care is co-designed and sensitively delivered.

These efforts have been extended to introducing nonpharmacological methods of pain management during labor. These approaches include mobility of women during labor, accompanying birth companions, alternative birth positions, and physical comfort (e.g., massage). The implementation of these interventions may be hampered by lack of or suboptimal physical space in the maternity ward.

Interventions include teaching curricula that sensitize caregivers to the experiences of women around the time of birth (e.g., video testimonials), accompanied by a set of \u201cchange ideas\u201d for implementation. Specific measures (e.g., presence of a birth companion) will be routinely tracked and reflected back to care providers to improve site-based adherence to these actions.",

Traditional measures of intervention coverage do not account for the quality of the services received; effective coverage (EC) is an approach to incorporating quality in coverage measures. However, this area of newborn health metrics is rife with gaps: gaps in available data on coverage, readiness, and service quality for newborns, and gaps in the methods for assessing service quality and estimating EC. These gaps limit our ability to understand the care currently received by newborns across low- and middle-income countries, making it more difficult to develop evidence-based programs and interventions. This panel will present recent research that aims to define and address some of these gaps, including the development of methods and indices to assess service quality for newborn health; assessment of readiness and quality data on newborns in facility registers and routine data systems; and development of EC cascades and measures for postnatal care, care for small and sick newborns, and feeding small and sick newborns.",

        " Background ",
        "Delivering high-quality health services to women and newborns around the time of delivery with a focus on birth, small and sick newborn care (SSNC), and postnatal care (PNC) is critical to making continued progress in reducing mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). LMICs are increasingly shifting focus toward improving the quality of health services delivered, which requires measuring quality of care (QoC) and monitoring progress. However, there are no standardized approaches to defining and measuring PNC and SSNC quality in these contexts. This study aims to systematically develop QoC indices for maternal PNC, newborn PNC, and SSNC.",
        " Methods ",
        "To define QoC measures for maternal PNC, newborn PNC, and SSNC in LMICs, we followed a four-step process: (1) identify globally recommended interventions for inclusion in indices, (2) extract service readiness items from intervention-specific clinical and service implementation guidelines, (3) map the identified items from the guidance documents to available data in health facility surveys, and (4) develop QoC metrics informed by QoC frameworks, clinical guidelines, and data availability.",
        " Results ",
        "The proposed maternal PNC QoC index reflects 11 interventions and contains 24 items. The proposed newborn PNC QoC index reflects three interventions and contains 16 items. The proposed SSNC QoC index reflects seven interventions and contains 37 items. Existing data sources have significant gaps for both PNC and SSNC, resulting in exclusion of some interventions and limitations on item inclusion. In addition, no provision of care data was available for PNC or SSNC, thus both indices reflect facility readiness only.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The indices provide a standardized measure for PNC and SSNC intervention readiness and can be adapted at the country level and operationalized using existing health facility assessment data, facilitating their use by LMIC decision-makers for planning and resource allocation. Revision of existing health facility assessments to address gaps in readiness and quality measurement for PNC and SSNC would bolster efforts to monitor and improve QoC for mothers and newborns.",

Feedback from a global group of stakeholders included that content was focused on global guidelines and clinical protocols, with less of an emphasis on what makes care person centered. In response, the toolkit material was re-organized by PCC principles, including a section focused on empathy and respectful care, exercises were developed to give guidance on how materials can be applied in practice, and a facilitator\u2019s guide was developed.

Parents who received information on nurturing and responsive care also reported increased interpersonal communication with providers (\u03b2 \u00b2=0.32; p=0.000). Post-intervention, providers reported improved self-awareness, recognition of sources of stressors, and understanding of different coping mechanisms. The intervention enhanced teamwork to balance stress and workload, allowing providers to engage with parents more and provide responsive and respectful care. Provider burnout levels, such as emotional exhaustion, also decreased between baseline and endline (from 63% to 37%) due to peer-to-peer support and psychological debriefing sessions.",

However, such data are subject to a number of known biases, including those due to misclassification with neonatal deaths and retrospective self-reporting. Previous research has shown that the extent and direction of misclassification vary across context. Reproductive-aged women, the respondents of retrospective surveys, do not always have accurate information on their babies\u2019 birth outcomes as they are not consistently informed by health care providers during and after delivery. Moreover, little is known about the under-reporting associated with retrospective surveys in stillbirths. This pre-formed panel offers new insights into these evidence gaps through three studies from Guinea-Bissau and Tanzania using mixed methods. Results from these studies could not only inform the interpretation and adjustment of retrospective survey and model-based stillbirth estimates for better progress tracking, but also identify suboptimal quality of care issues in delivery and postpartum care to further improve maternal and newborn outcomes.

Since 2010, we have also registered births to women under surveillance even if the births were not to be followed prospectively. For births registered between 2012 and 2020, we estimated the SBR (a) using the standard Bandim Health Project method including only prospectively followed pregnancies and (b) assuming full information on all births, thus estimating the SBR based on both prospectively and retrospectively registered births.",

Overall, the SBR was 58.6 (55.7\u201361.5) per 1,000 births for the prospective method and 53.4 (50.9\u201356.0) for the method assuming full information. Thus, assuming full information significantly underestimated the SBR by 5.2 (1.3\u20139.0) stillbirths per 1,000 births (adjusted risk ratio (aRR)=0.91 (0.90\u20130.92)) The entire difference in rates was limited to the cohort with visits every six months: aRR=0.85 (0.83\u20130.87) while there was no difference when households were visited every two months (aRR=1.01 (0.97\u20131.04)) or one (aRR=1.01 (0.98\u20131.03)) month.

Among stillbirths, 15.7% were misclassified by the TDHS as neonatal deaths; and 5.9% of neonatal deaths were misclassified as stillbirths. Bivariate analyses suggest that misclassification was more common among intrapartum stillbirths than neonatal deaths due to communicable causes, and among women attended to by a doctor, those in higher wealth quintiles, those with fewer antenatal contacts, and those living in urban areas. Multivariate analyses indicate the misclassification is significantly associated with cause of death, provider type, and the absence of birth abnormalities.",

There are some challenges in measuring this indicator, including obtaining accurate gestational assessment and other obstetric information. Data for ACS coverage may be captured in individually linked clinical records, but would be more challenging in registers/tally sheets. Contextual factors are important.",
        "To calculate coverage of antibiotic treatment for newborn infection using RHIS data, we recommend the following numerator: number of newborns identified as infection cases who also received at least two days of appropriate injectable antibiotics, including cases of possible serious bacterial infection (critical illness or clinical severe infection) in outpatient settings or clinically suspected sepsis in inpatient settings. The denominator is the number of identified infection cases in both inpatient and outpatient settings.",

Yet, 80% of the 30 million newborns that require inpatient care each year do not receive it. To address this critical gap, ENAP added a fourth target on SSNB for countries to achieve by 2025: 80% of countries have a national implementation plan for SSNB care and 80% of districts have a functional level 2 inpatient unit to care for SSNB with respiratory support, including continuous positive airway pressure. To guide countries\u2019 efforts toward achieving this target, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) have developed standards for improving the quality of care for SSNB in health facilities and a model of level 2 care.",

The aim is to generate discussion of practical approaches to design, implement, and continuously monitor these complex systems to enable timely access to life-saving services in different contexts.",
        "The conceptual framework was developed by members of the management committee for the global Community of Practice for Transport and Referral, based at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; the multi-country analysis was conducted by FHI 360 with funding from the Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program at Columbia University. Implementation perspectives come from a USAID-funded project in Mozambique and an emergency management institute in India.",

        " Background ",
        "There is a gap in referral system measurement and a need to identify the key elements of referral system inputs and processes that lead to a functioning system. Further, referral systems are complex systems difficult to summarize with any one indicator. Given this, we aimed to develop an initial composite indicator that captures multiple dimensions of referral systems through easily measured indicators that describe system readiness.",
        " Methods ",
        "Based on the literature, WHO guidelines, and relevant experiences, we identified six key dimensions of referrals through consensus. We mapped existing data from national emergency obstetric and newborn care assessments to these dimensions. Using data from more than 6,000 health facilities across Ghana, Zambia, Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Malawi from 2010\u20132020, we performed descriptive analysis of indicators aligning with the referral dimensions. We then constructed a composite indicator: we scored and standardized variables, aggregated scores by dimension, weighted each dimension equally, and summed them for a total score presented as a percentage. We used descriptive analysis to compare referral system readiness across factors.",
        " Results ",
        "The six dimensions comprise (1) transportation readiness, (2) referral efficiency and coordination of care, (3) care during transport, (4) financial accessibility of referral, (5) interfacility relational dynamics, and (6) family-centered care. Existing data aligned with dimensions 1-4; while important, data on dimensions 5-6 are rarely captured and represent a gap in current monitoring efforts. Composite indicator scores ranged from 41% to 54%. Financial accessibility of referral remained the strongest dimension across countries, with scores of 53% in Ghana to 97% in Zambia. Care during transport was consistently the weakest with scores of 10% in Malawi to 32% in Zambia. Across countries, the mean composite score was higher for hospitals than for other health facilities, with a 15% to 19% difference between groups. In most countries, health facilities ranking in the top quintile of referral readiness also represented the largest proportion of monthly deliveries.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "These results demonstrate a method to succinctly measure referral system readiness. The proposed framework and composite indicator could be routinely used to monitor progress, identify gaps, and guide referral system strengthening efforts.",

        " Background ",
        "Referral is a widely used and broad term that covers a range of journeys that women and newborns must make to and between health facilities. Referrals are a complicated concept that rely on the interactions between the personnel and structures of health systems, transportation, clinical guidelines, health-seeking behaviors of patients and caregivers, public and private providers, and sociodemographic factors, among other dimensions. Monitoring an effective interfacility health-related transfer system requires a framework that can conceptualize interactions between dimensions that contribute to the outcome of interest and highlight specific areas of focus for improved performance.",
        "For this work, we have focused on interfacility emergency obstetric and neonatal transfers. We build on existing conceptual frameworks such as the Three Delays model, Social Determinants of Health, and WHO guidance on transport during emergencies, among others, to address aspects of interfacility health-related transfers. Each framework has its limitations largely because of the service use and service organization assumptions that underlie them. These frameworks were designed for different theoretical settings and propose varying operational and measurement approaches.",
        " Methods ",
        "We conducted a narrative review of frameworks that describe dimensions of interfacility health-related transfers. In addition, content analysis was undertaken to conceptualize how the dimensions of each framework can be synthesized to address considerations for measurement.",
        " Results ",
        "To inform future efforts to improve interfacility transfers, we propose an integrated conceptual framework that we believe can assist health care managers and researchers in synthesizing evidence, understanding phenomena, and informing attempts to improve service, ensuring that pregnant women and newborns get to the right place at the right time and receive the right care. In addition, we propose using specific terminology to describe aspects of interfacility health-related transfers to assist in harmonizing concepts across study settings, health conditions, and severity.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "This proposed conceptual framework and common language for interfacility health-related transfers provide an overarching model and language that may help guide the development, validation, implementation, and interpretation of measures and suggests boundaries for the health system\u2019s responsibilities.",

The Vulnerable Newborn Measurement Collaboration of >250 members analyzed data from 24 countries to estimate the neonatal mortality risks for six newborn types.",
        " Methods ",
        "We included 125.5 million live births in high-middle-income settings and 225,441 live births in low-and middle-income settings with exposure data and linked neonatal survival, 2000 and 2020. We assigned six types combining gestational age (preterm [PT] or term [T]) and size for gestational age (Small-, Large-, or Appropriate-for gestational age [SGA, LGA, AGA]). Medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for prevalence, mortality rate, and relative risk ratio (RR) for four small types (PT+SGA, PT+AGA, PT+LGA, T+SGA), one large (T+LGA), and one reference (T+AGA).",
        " Results ",
        "As expected, the most common type was T+AGA (median: 68.8% in high- and 54% in lower-income settings). In higher income settings, T+AGA had the lowest mortality rate (median: 0.6 deaths per 1,000 livebirths), and in lower-income settings it was T+LGA (7.2 deaths) followed by T+AGA (11.6 deaths). Preterm newborn faced the highest risks. In high-income settings, the median mortality RR was PT+SGA (68.2, IQR: 56.1-78.0), PT+AGA (34.3, IQR: 23.9-37.5), PT+LGA (28.3, IQR: 22.6-32.3), followed by T+SGA (5.4, IQR: 4.2-6.3). In lower-income settings, preterm babies also had higher mortality risk: PT+SGA (10.0, IQR: 5.5-10.4), PT+AGA (4.5, IQR: 4.3-6.3), PT+LGA (4.9, IQR: 2.5-7.7), followed by T+SGA (2.5, IQR: 2.0-2.7). No additional risk was found for T+LGA in high- (0.8, IQR: 0.8-0.8) or low-income settings (0.9, IQR: 0.8-1.0).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Four small vulnerable newborn types all have increased mortality risk in all settings. Preterm types have a much higher risk and account for the largest population attributable risk. PT+SGA babies are rarer, but face the greatest risks. Lower-income settings have a higher mortality risk for all babies, which reduces the RR, but is associated with more deaths in absolute numbers.",

Absence of a unified classification system to estimate prevalence of detailed newborn outcomes presents challenges for targeting preventive and therapeutic interventions to the most vulnerable. We analyzed data based on a new classification and present results on prevalence of six newborn types from 43 countries, 2000 to 2021.",
        " Methods ",
        "This secondary analysis used datasets from 23 countries with strong national data systems (primarily high- and middle-income countries ) and 45 subnational (23 countries), population-based studies with high-quality birth outcome data (primarily low- and middle-income countries ). We defined a set of six newborn types using gestational age (preterm [PT], term [T]) and weight-for-gestational age (small-for-gestational age [SGA], appropriate-for-gestational age [AGA], large-for-gestational age [LGA]) using the Intergrowth 21st newborn standard. We defined small types as any type with PT or SGA. Separately for national and subnational sources, we calculated the prevalence of newborn types by country or study and presented information on data quality, study, and participant characteristics.",

        "Our study is the first to provide multi-country analysis of newborn types, using more than 170 million livebirths from 43 countries across six SDG regions. Identification of specific newborn types was feasible and revealed high prevalence of small newborn types with variations across region, setting, and time. More surprisingly, we found a high rate of large for gestational age in several regions.

Most of this burden could be averted, but global nutrition and survival targets are off track. Transformation of data availability, quality, and use is crucial to inform investments in prevention and care. As part of UN estimates, Lancet SVN series, and Born Too Soon report, we reviewed national-level outcome data for all UN member states during 20 years to inform data transformation.",
        " Methods ",
        "National routine administrative data on LBW, preterm birth, and SGA for all 194 WHO member states and the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, were systematically collated in a global database, 2000 to 2020. Data availability and quality were systematically assessed.",

        "Most UN member states (124/195, 64%) had data on LBW, compared with 82/195 (40%) for preterm birth and just 8 countries for SGA. Routine data system reporting was highest in North America, Australia, and Europe, where in 2019 ~95% of livebirths had LBW data and > 75% had preterm birth data. In contrast, just 13% of livebirths in Sub-Saharan Africa had national information on LBW and only 8% on preterm birth. In South Asia, 16% of livebirths had national information on LBW and only 5% on preterm birth. Most low- and middle-income country data were collected through hospital-based systems with aggregate data. Data quality was generally high in the North American, Australasian, and European region, although only ~25% of countries reported metadata for gestational age assessment method, commonly reported as Last Menstrual Period.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Every baby, including stillbirths, should be counted, weighed, and assessed. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have data gaps, but also opportunities for rapid progress given the majority of births in facilities, and expansion of electronic health information systems that already include LBW data. Gestational age can be incorporated, linked to improved assessment, which is increasingly feasible. Adding individually linked data will enable countries to track individual quality of care and long-term outcomes, crucial for every family and to track SDG and Every Newborn progress.",

Although more surgical births were needed to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and complications, current rates in some India states and hospitals are reaching more than 60%.

We conducted in-depth interviews with lawyers, obstetricians, and women\u2019s representatives, using a semi-structured interview guide. Framework analysis techniques were used to map interview data to behavioral drivers and mental models developed in the review phase of the project. Two workshops were then held to explore attitudes and intentions of medical and legal participants toward CS because of fear of litigation.",

        "Nineteen participants were interviewed. Twenty-four attended the workshops. Mean years of experience was 26 years; median age 52 years. Fear of litigation was a significant concern for the participating doctors. This was a surprise for some of the participating lawyers. However, medical fearfulness extended beyond litigation, including fear of physical attack from disgruntled families, and fear of being shamed and of suffering reputational loss on social media.",

        " Results ",
        "The formative research has shown that few local clinical protocols used for labor and delivery management are evidence-based. Most providers were comfortable with the idea of a local opinion leader to promote good clinical practice. After a five-day training, opinion leaders introduced WHO algorithms to participating hospitals and audit methods to evaluate clinical practices. The Robson classification is well accepted by providers, but its interpretation remains difficult without continuous support. The decision analysis tool to support an informed choice of the mode of delivery is welcomed by women and providers in both versions: a paper-based and web-based application \u201cProviders are fairly supportive to help women choose a companion during labor and delivery, but lack of space and privacy is a main barrier in many contexts.",

Midwifery providers confirmed in reflexive sessions the unresponsiveness and explained being overburdened and their feeling of helplessness. Our competency-based training targeting the needs developed during the co-design phase supporting reflective exercises and to implement changes, such as sign boards and on-site payment to speed up formal admission. Our quality improvement component aiming to implement operational and structural innovations was difficult to implement in several facilities, probably as midwifery providers felt too disempowered and needed time to understand the structured nature of quality improvement. In contrast, mentoring was substantially easier to integrate. Physical mentoring was preferred over WhatsApp, which has cost and time implications.",

There is a global inequity in birth defects prevention through proven public health interventions such as staple food fortification with folic acid, an essential micronutrient. We present the epidemiology of neural tube birth defects that are largely preventable, and the method of preventing them through food fortification. Nutrition International and Food Fortification Initiative will present their work in achieving global prevention of neural tube defects. We will also present a story of advocacy, featuring the Global Alliance for Prevention of Folic Acid-Preventable Spina Bifida (GAPSBiF).

        "Inadequate intake of micronutrients like folic acid can lead to neural tube defects and other serious health consequences. The large-scale fortification of wheat flour, maize flour, and rice with folic acid is a proven, cost-effective intervention to prevent folate deficiency in women of reproductive age and consequences like neural tube defects. The Food Fortification Initiative (FFI) is a public-private-civic partnership that has mapped the opportunity for grain fortification worldwide and provides technical guidance to countries to implement fortification programs. FFI\u2019s goal is to help eliminate micronutrient deficiencies in every country in the world where industrially milled cereal grain is commonly consumed.",
        " Methods ",
        "Before FFI begins working in a country, FFI uses data to determine two essential requirements: demonstrated need for fortification and the potential to make a positive impact on health through fortified grains. FFI\u2019s data comes from varied sources and methods that include consumption and milling analyses, nutrition needs assessments, market analyses, political readiness assessments, systematic reviews, and partner interviews. Once an opportunity for fortification is determined, FFI uses a four-stage phased approach to help countries plan, implement, and monitor a fortification program that can generate and sustain large-scale impact.",
        " Results ",
        "When providing technical assistance, FFI uses a four-stage approach: explore and engage, map the context, design and develop, and monitor for compliance and impact. To ensure that fortification programs have a positive health impact on the population and prevent neural tube defects, FFI encourages countries to create standards and mandatory legislation for folic acid fortification. As of September 2022, 92 countries currently mandate the fortification of wheat flour, maize flour, or rice. In 2021, FFI found that 31%, 30%, and 1% of industrially milled wheat flour, maize, and rice, respectively, is fortified.",

        "The Food Fortification Initiative database was used to identify countries with mandatory fortification policies with folic acid added to cereal grains. We examined status of FAP SBA prevention assuming mandatory folic acid fortification at 200 mcg/day fully protects against FAP SBA and reduces their prevalence to a minimum achievable rate of 0.5 cases/1,000 live births. The country-specific annual number of FAP SBA cases prevented was quantified as the maximum prevention potential possible for any of the fortified grain examined (wheat flour/maize flour/rice) based on the level of total folic acid consumption from fortified grain examined and the fortification program coverage.",
        " Results ",
        "Our analysis showed that 61,677 FAP SBA cases were prevented in the year 2020 through mandatory folic acid fortification of cereal grains in 58 countries, translating to 22% prevention of total possible FAP SBA prevention globally. Many countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe are yet to implement fortification. In 2020, 30 years after the Medical Research Council study was published, 218,270 preventable FAP SBA cases still occurred globally.",

        "Even more tragically, most of these deaths could have been avoided with high-quality care during the antenatal period and birth. More than 40 percent of all stillbirths occur during labor; many could have been prevented with improved monitoring and access to emergency obstetric care.",
        "Despite its magnitude, these losses remain a neglected issue.

        " Methods ",
        "As part of the stillbirth estimation process in 2018, the WHO, UNICEF and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine reviewed current ICD guidance and commonly used definitions of stillbirth and developed a proposal to clarify definitions in ICD-11 to improve the consistency and comparability of stillbirth data. The proposal was then reviewed and revised by the Core Stillbirth Estimation Group, the technical advisory group of United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation.

        "A variety of community surveys are conducted, including the Demographic and Health Survey, specific mortality surveys that capture stillbirths, and some surveys that capture neonatal deaths, but not stillbirths. We reviewed the design, questionnaire, and data collection methods for major surveys to document issues that hinder robust estimation of stillbirth rate and risk factors for stillbirths.",
        " Results ",
        "Documentation of stillbirth magnitude is affected by the documentation of gestation period, confirmation of stillbirth, and how a stillbirth is differentiated from a live birth that died soon after birth. Importantly, documentation is also affected by the extent of importance given to stillbirth documentation by the survey leads. Training of interviewers in ascertaining stillbirth in the context of stigma is also important for increasing robustness of stillbirth documentation. It is important to note that stillbirth registration is not documented in most surveys, which hinders understanding of underreporting of stillbirths in the vital registration system. Most surveys do not capture details of pregnancy that resulted in a stillbirth and focus on pregnancies resulting in a live birth, as the primary aim is to address neonatal mortality. Inclusion of pregnancies that resulted in stillbirth and capturing additional risk factors relevant for stillbirths is crucial to address the gap toward stillbirth prevention. Questions to differentiate antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths are needed to facilitate specificity in action. The utility of verbal autopsy in stillbirth capture will be discussed.",

Fear of needles and drug reactions, presumed high cost, and health talk not centered around IV iron were deemed potential barriers. HCPs highlighted IV iron as a preferred alternative to blood transfusion, given its advantages over oral iron. However, HCPs emphasized the need for adequate training for safe administration and concerns over additional workload in light of the already overstretched human resources.

        "FHI 360 is working in northeast Nigeria to improve the survival and nutritional status of newborns and infants amid the ongoing conflict. Breastfeeding is a determining factor for the survival, growth, and development of infants in humanitarian contexts. A child who is exclusively breastfed is 14 times less likely to die in the first six months of life; however, cultural barriers and social factors influence recommended breastfeeding practices. The Father-to-Father Support Groups (FtFSGs) initiative was created in recognition of the critical role that men play in decision-making around infant feeding. During the meetings, members share experiences, support each other, and learn from the counseling cards, and the various demonstrations and roleplays.",
        " Methods ",
        "FHI 360 conducted a quasi-experimental impact assessment to evaluate how FtFSGs influence breastfeeding. The method involved both intervention and comparison groups, and multistage sampling was used based on probability to selected settlements and households in Ngala, Banki, and Damasak, proportionate to population size.",
        " Results ",
        "Most newborns (93.9%) in households of FtFSG members were reported to have been breastfed within one hour of birth, contrary to 59.2% of non-FtFSG members. Exclusive breastfeeding up to six months in households of FtFSG members was also reported in most cases (96.4%), compared to 57.1% of households without FtFSG members. One of the FtFSG members stated, \u201cThe knowledge I acquired during my participation in the support group has improved my life through practice by ensuring I provided food varieties to my family that meet their nutritional needs, ensure any child that is sick is presented to the health facility immediately, and support my wife to breastfeed our children by reducing her work load.\u201d",

        "The assessment confirmed the importance of males in breastfeeding support and other care practices, especially in humanitarian contexts. FtFSGs positively influenced early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding practices.

        "The six years of armed conflict in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon facilitated the displacement of skilled health workers. This contributed to decreased access to basic health care for pregnant women (PW). Many internally displaced persons and vulnerable populations lost their income sources and experienced exacerbated needs for sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services including family planning (FP), antenatal care, and delivery services. Funded by GIZ Pro-Passar, Reach Out Cameroon implemented a humanitarian response project aimed to improve access to and uptake of quality SRHR services for women and girls in these conflict-affected regions.",
        " Methods ",
        "The project was implemented in the Northwest and Southwest regions, from April 2022 to August 2022. Thirty SRHR volunteers (SRHRVs) were selected and trained to communicate the importance of SRHR and psychosocial health services. SRHRVs identified and referred PW for antenatal care, facility delivery, or FP, and provided service vouchers for the most vulnerable. A three-month stock of obstetric and FP supplies was donated to 30 health facilities, where 60 nurses were trained to provide skilled normal and assisted deliveries, effectively plot a partograph, and administer FP services. The project team conducted monthly supervision, data review, and validation missions.",

A total of 184 vulnerable PW were given vouchers, with 319 PW referred. Two months before implementation, the 30 health facilities recorded only 121 of 234 (52%) deliveries were conducted by skilled personnel. After implementation, 518 of 544 (95.2%) deliveries were conducted by skilled personnel and 213 vulnerable PW received vouchers. Free modern FP services were provided to 574 women including 40 nursing mothers.",

        "The total number of facility deliveries and those conducted by skilled personnel increased significantly. In conflict settings, barriers to quality SRHR services worsened. It is important that humanitarian responses integrate strategies that increase service demand, quality, and supply. Community-led-communication and cash voucher systems can break existing barriers for the most vulnerable and stimulate demand.

Insufficient physical resources and psychological support was further exacerbated by expectations to meet unrealistic targets. Providers then faced moral dilemmas when they could not provide the expected standard of care. Citizen\u2019s expectations were also not met, and frontline providers took the blame for system failures.

There is growing momentum and investment in reaching zero-dose children and addressing the gross inequity in the reach of health services. To effectively address this inequity, there is an urgent need to characterize the zero-dose population, their mothers, and the barriers they face in accessing care.",

        "Data from Demographic and Health Survey and Mulitple Indicator Cluster Surveys from 2011 to 2020 in low-, lower-, middle-, and upper-middle-income countries were utilized. Zero-dose status was defined as children 12\u201323 months who had not received any doses of BCG, DTP, polio and measles-containing vaccines. We characterized the zero-dose population by sociodemographic and health access factors. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine household-level factors associated with zero-dose immunization status.",

        "We included 82 countries in our univariate analyses and 68 countries in our multivariate model. Overall, 7.5% of the population were zero-dose children, with half (51.9%) living in African countries.

Yet, surprisingly, a substantial proportion of zero-dose children\u2019s mothers received appropriate care during pregnancy (33.5% have mothers with at least four ANC visits). Controlling for other factors, children had three times the odds (OR=3.00, p< 0.05) of being zero-dose if their mother had not received tetanus injections, 2.46 times the odds (p< 0.05) if their mother had not received ANC visits, and nearly twice the odds (OR=1.87, p< 0.05) if their mother had a home delivery, compared to children of mothers who received the recommended care.",

They are intended for internal school self-assessment that guides identification of school-specific investment and improvement priorities. The ECFs have recently been field-tested. Our objectives were to:",
        " Methods ",
        "Teams in Ghana, Botswana, and Togo field-tested each of the five pre-service midwifery ECFs. Each team included representatives from a regional midwifery organization and a public midwifery school. We summarized each country\u2019s self-assessment data and feedback on using the ECFs using descriptive statistics.",
        " Results ",
        "In the three countries, capacity levels across domains ranged from 10% to 63%. Botswana reported the highest overall capacity (49%), followed by Ghana (41%), and Togo (24%). Overall, teams reported the highest capacity level for infrastructure and management; the lowest for clinical sites. Preliminary analyses suggest the ECFs are comprehensive, easy to use, and highlight school-specific challenges not previously recognized. Participants indicated the ECFs were acceptable, appropriate and feasible to use. The teams subsequently used the ECF data to draft a specific plan for investment and improvement in their priority domain.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The ECFs are a promising tool for midwifery schools to internally assess and prioritize areas for investment and improvement. Individual school results can guide internal budgetary decisions and help prepare for external assessments. Results from groups of schools have the potential to inform systems\u2019 level investment. Additional research is needed to determine the ECFs\u2019 appropriateness in other settings. Findings from this field test are being used to further refine the ECFs for future use.",

        "The neonatal mortality rate (NMR) in Nepal decreased from 58 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 17 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2020. The NMR declined by 3.7% between 1990 to 1999, 3.9% between 2000 to 2009, and 3.6% between 2010 to 2019 indicating that the pace of decline has been relatively slower in recent decades. Although notable progress has been made in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality at the national level, there are disparities across different socioeconomic strata. This study attempts to assess the inequities in coverage of maternal and newborn health (MNH) service coverage and identify the opportunities for equitable service coverage in the federalized context.",
        " Methods ",
        "This was a multi-method study. We performed further analysis of the 2019 Nepal Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey data to identify the inequities in maternal and newborn health service coverage. We conducted consultative workshops at the provincial (three) and federal levels (one) and key informant interviews of policymakers, program implementers, service providers, academicians, and researchers working on newborn health.",
        " Results ",
        "Coverage of MNH services (computed as composite index combining antenatal coverage, including blood pressure measurement, urine and blood test, institutional delivery, and postnatal care for newborns) was 73% in Bagmati province and 34 % each in Madhesh and Karnali provinces, demonstrating two-folds difference in service coverage. Development of locally tailored program interventions, micro-planning to cater health needs in underserved areas, efficient procurement and supply of medicines, expansion of services at primary-level facilities, promoting gatekeeping function, reducing caseload at tertiary-level facilities, linking facilities at multiple levels with appropriate referral system, effective implementation of free newborn care, and health insurance schemes were among the key strategies suggested to improve newborn health and overcome inequities in service utilization.",

Observed rates at the facility level vary due to case mix and that their appropriateness is difficult to assess as they could reflect either overuse or unmet need of CS. Unsafe provision of CS quality of care endangers patient outcomes. The Family Welfare Division (FWD) adapted the WHO Robson TGCS Guideline 2017 and piloted it in four hospitals, and was recently rolled out to 33 hospitals across the country.",

CS rates per Robson group were higher for almost all groups across hospitals than the WHO reference, indicating a likely inappropriate use of the intervention for some cases in these hospitals. Critical shortage of staff, high workloads, lack of use of partograph, and lack of use of augmentation for non-progress of labor were some of the reasons for the inappropriate use of CS.",

        "We collected facility readiness data specific to ANC in five health posts in Sarlahi, Nepal, using a rapid cycle approach (quarterly over a one-year period). Readiness was assessed across several domains: overall ANC inventory, infrastructure, equipment, essential medication, laboratory tests and diagnostics, human resources, and documentation and guidelines. Facility readiness scores were developed using two scoring methods (domain-weighted, simple-additive) and two item selection methods (all items, core items). Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess variability and distribution of readiness scores across time, domains, and facilities.",

        "When assessing scores across domains for all facilities and time points, domain-specific ranges of scores indicated high variability in readiness overall: Infrastructure (41%\u201372%), equipment (45%\u201371%), essential medication (20%\u201360%), laboratory tests and diagnostics (0%\u201385%), and documentation and guidelines (30%\u201390%), with a higher score indicating better readiness. Facility-specific scores over time pointed to infrastructure being the least variable (average change of 6.70%) compared to laboratory tests and diagnostics being most variable (average change 31.42%). Within each facility, certain items, such as calcium tablets and urine glucose tests, were observed to be most time-variant, whereas the availability of a functional manual blood pressure apparatus, stethoscope, and weighing scale were observed to be stable or time-invariant. Chronic facility challenges across all facilities were observed with regards to the availability of personal protective equipment.",

        "In Niger and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, maternity services in three out of four health facilities were understaffed (WISN ratio < 1), with very high workload pressure (41%\u201360%), while in Burkina Faso they were either overstaffed or at least equally staffed (WISN ratio \u2265 1). In Niger, all dispensary services were understaffed, and in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, rural services were understaffed. In Burkina Faso, most of these services were either overstaffed or adequately staffed.

        "Two billion people are affected by anemia globally. Most are women of reproductive age (WRA) and those residing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Maternal anemia is associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother and the baby. Large national population-representative studies examining the impact of national grain fortification policies on the prevalence of anemia among WRA for recent years are lacking. The objective of our study was to determine whether mandatory national grain fortification policies reduce the prevalence of anemia among non-pregnant WRA.",
        " Methods ",
        "We examined national food fortification policy characteristics from the Global Fortification Data Exchange (GFDx) database and anemia prevalence data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). In total, 21 LMICs, with and without national grain fortification policies, completing at least two DHS between 2000 and 2018, met study eligibility. We applied the difference-in-differences approach to compare changes in the prevalence of anemia among WRA in 10 countries with and 11 countries without fortification between each DHS year. Odds ratios (ORs) and average marginal effects, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated and adjusted for individual-, household-, and country-level factors.",
        " Results ",
        "Our analytic study sample included 96,334 and 874,984 WRA in countries with and without fortification, respectively. Overall, countries with fortification in the pre- versus post-fortification period showed 27% decreased odds of anemia (aOR=0.73, 95% CI=0.63, 0.85) and a 7.47 percentage point decrease in the mean anemia prevalence (average marginal effect: \u22127.47, 95% CI=\u221211.03, \u22123.92), compared to countries without fortification, after controlling for selected individual-, household-, and country-level factors.",

        "Our findings, using nationally representative DHS data and applying a recommended analytic method to measure policy effectiveness, suggest significant reductions in anemia prevalence in WRA in countries with mandatory grain fortification compared to those without. Implementing national mandatory grain fortification in LMICs would effectively reduce anemia resulting from micronutrient deficiencies among WRA. This has the potential for improved maternal and child health outcomes and reduced morbidity and mortality in newborns.",

        "The survey was designed to capture a sample of 10,000 live births representative of rural Bihar between January 2019 and July 2020 using a multistage sampling strategy. For each identified birth, a detailed interview was conducted with the child\u2019s mother or the most knowledgeable person to document the place of delivery, whether the birth or neonatal death was registered, and the availability of the respective certificate. For the births and deaths where a relevant certificate was not available, the reasons for nonavailability were documented. Data collection was completed between August 2020 and April 2021.",
        " Results ",
        "Detailed interviews were available for 8,696 live births (82.9% participation) and 208 neonatal deaths (82% participation). Birth certificate availability was reported for 5,919 live births (68.8%; 95% CI 67.8\u201369.7), and this coverage was significantly higher for live births delivered at public sector facilities as compared with the private sector and home births. It was also significantly higher for girls than boys. The birth certificate coverage for live births who did not survive the neonatal period was 2.8 times lower (24.6%; 95% CI 17.6\u201333.3) than for those who survived the neonatal period. Overall, 48.1% of neonatal deaths were at home irrespective of place of delivery. None of the neonatal deaths had a death certificate. The most common reason provided was the baby died immediately after birth or too young (33.2%), followed by no need for it (42.8%) and did not think about it (25%).

Other women preferred home delivery as it is perceived to preserve dignity and respect the demands of a marriage setup. Traditional initiation ceremonies (Chinamwali in Eastern province), used to teach and guide girls\u2019 sexual orientation once they reach puberty, facilitate adolescent girls\u2019 early sexual debut, exacerbating the prevalence of teenage pregnancies and increased fistula cases as girls are eager to practice the teachings.

A broad spectrum of conditions were included as NCDs, including pregnancy-specific conditions and infectious diseases. Most publications were from academic institutions in high-income countries and focus predominantly on the preconception and antepartum periods.",
        "In the second review, we identified 6,026 articles, of which 405 guidelines were included. Current patterns of guidance were identified: recommendations largely focused on antenatal care, with few addressing intrapartum and postnatal care. There was a lack of guidance focusing on NCDs as a holistic topic. More than 90% of guidelines were published from high-income countries.",

This limits the financial protection of mothers, contributes to lower quality care, and disrupts continuity of care throughout pregnancies due to the limited access that private midwives, and the facilities they work in, have to publicly funded health care goods and equipment.",

There is limited data on cause of these deaths globally, and therefore, improving understanding of chronological timing (antepartum/intrapartum/early and late neonatal), gestational age timing (preterm, term, post-term) and their contributing risk factors are first steps towards prevention. Misclassification of perinatal deaths by skin changes at birth can impact this understanding and requires further exploration.",
        " Methods ",
        "Secondary data analysis of the PRECISE-DYAD prospective cohort study of women giving birth in two facilities in Kenya between 2019-2022 was undertaken. Stillbirths were classified as antepartum or intrapartum based on fetal heart rate (FHR) on admission and as early (before 28 completed weeks) and late (after 28 weeks) gestation stillbirths. Neonatal deaths were classified as early (before day 7) and late (day 7\u201328) neonatal deaths. Stillbirths were considered potentially misclassified if reported skin appearance at birth was discordant with FHR status on admission. Evidence of association of misclassification by method of FHR was explored. Key contributing risk factors associated with these deaths were explored.",

        "52 stillbirths (38.5% antepartum, 38.5% intrapartum, and 23% unknown) and 14 neonatal deaths (10 early) were reported among 2,090 total births. Nearly three-quarter (73.8%) of stillbirths and 80% of early neonatal deaths were born at 28 or more weeks of gestation. Misclassification of intrapartum stillbirths was observed when skin appearance was used at birth instead of FHR on admission, and it varied depending on FHR method. The odds of skin changes of maceration/peeling reported for intrapartum stillbirths was 2.3 times higher when Pinard stethoscope was used. Preterm gestational age (p-value less than 0.001) and multiple gestation (p=0.02) were important risk factors for these deaths.",

This is inspite of recent progress made towards reducing mortality rates, from 398 per 100,000 live births in 2014 to 278 per 100,000 live births in 2018. The major factors contributing to high maternal and infant mortality rates in Zambia are associated with the three delays in accessing health services: the delays in deciding to seek care, the delay in accessing a facility, and the delay in accessing services of a skilled health worker. Within the context of the three delays, the choice of facility location is critical. However, identifying and prioritizing the precise location with the greatest potential of increasing access to maternal services is in practice not a straightforward process, more so in resource-constrained settings where the need for infrastructure is pervasive. A baseline study conducted in Eastern and Southern provinces of Zambia established that 72% of eligible facilities in Eastern and 65% in Southern had no capacity to support maternal services.

To address this gap, a district continuous quality improvement team worked with health facility leadership to audit all FSBs at their facilities. This process identified modifiable factors contributing to FSBs. These factors were then prioritized and used to inform the development of facility action plans. Actions included supporting mentorship for midwives on labor monitoring, newborn resuscitation and educating pregnant women on birth preparedness and harmful practices.

This formative qualitative analysis was conducted as part of the CHV-NEO research study (NCT05187897). We aimed to elicit stakeholders\u2019 perspectives and feedback on the impact of CHVs on maternal and newborn health.",
        " Methods ",
        "Between April and August 2022, 16 key informant interviews with health workers and policy-makers and 12 focus group discussions (FGD) with CHVs and PPW were conducted in western Kenya. Interviews were facilitated by trained Kenyan social scientists using semi-structured guides in participants\u2019 preferred languages (English, Kiswahili, or Dholuo).

Stakeholders found CHVs helpful in improving the health and knowledge of PPW, including strategies for identifying newborn and antenatal danger signs and appropriate interventions. Stakeholders felt that CHVs facilitate improved uptake and access to skilled delivery and antenatal/postnatal care through education during home visits and create trust and bridge gaps between communities and the health system. CHVs expressed their motivations to work included their impact and skills building through training. Other stakeholders stated monthly stipend and recognition from the community and health system as other CHV motivations.

        "We estimated excess maternal mortality using two approaches. First, we used a population attributable fraction approach, which utilized GBD estimates of COVID-19 deaths and pregnancy prevalence to estimate the number of COVID-19 deaths in people who were pregnant. We then estimated the proportion of these deaths attributable to the pregnancy by applying an attributable fraction estimated from literature on the relative risk of death in pregnant versus non-pregnant COVID-19-positive women of reproductive age. Second, we used an excess mortality approach, which utilized processed vital registration data for direct and indirect maternal deaths separately for 30 countries from 2000\u20132020 and GBD-estimated COVID-19 mortality rates. Maternal mortality rates were used as inputs in meta-regression, Bayesian, regularized, trimmed, with geographic cascading splines for the random effect of time, and a fixed effect for COVID-19 mortality, to predict excess indirect maternal mortality for observed and counterfactual COVID-19-free scenarios. The ratio of observed versus counterfactual predictions was then modeled as a function of COVID-19 mortality for all locations and applied as correction factors to adjust GBD 2021 indirect maternal death estimates.",

The proportion of women who deliver in health facilities has steadily increased in every region of the world, though gains have not been uniform. In many low- and middle-income countries, women are accustomed, and often prefer, to deliver at home. Identifying what makes certain groups vulnerable and understanding why women deliver at home is critical for customizing interventions to maximize impact. Population segmentation is a tool that allows us to categorize populations into distinct subgroups based on multiple dimensions of vulnerability so we can identify, prioritize, and target specific needs.",

SSP, previously known as Prime Minister National Health Program, was introduced in 2015 to pave the way for universal health coverage (UHC). It was initially implemented in 40 districts and is currently functional in over 90 districts of Azad Jammu and Kashmi, Gilgit-Baltistan, Islamabad Capital Territory, Punjab, Newly Merged\u00a0Districts\u00a0of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Tharparkar district of Sindh, in Pakistan SSP provides financial health protection to identified indigent citizens against catastrophic health expenditure. Initially Program was using data from National Socioeconomic Registry and defined poverty as families with daily income lower than USD 2. Now all individuals of aforesaid covered areas registered with National Database Registration Authority are automatically enrolled in SSP, with the eventual goal of universal coverage across Pakistan",

The objective of the study was to assess the role of Sehat Sahulat program in improving RMNCH outcomes by comparing the UHC service coverage score (UHC SCI) and RMNCH score of 2015 to 2021 in the initial SSP 40 districts and percentage change in UHC SCI in the initial SSP 40 districts.

However, there is a need to consider expanding the benefit package in terms of both services and population coverage with a shift from health protection to health insurance scheme. The limitations study is that it only looks at change in UHC SCI and did not look at the utilization of services and Financial protection of the target population.

        "Multi-country randomized controlled trial conducted in five countries (India, Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria, Malawi,) coordinated by the World Health Organization (iKMC study) from Nov 2017\u2013Jan 2020 showed 25% reduction in mortality by immediate kangaroo mother care (KMC) in neonates with birthweight 1 to< 1.8 kg. This study was published in New England Journal of Medicine (May 2021). To implement immediate KMC (iKMC) intervention, mother and baby needed to be together continuously, which led to the concept of mother-newborn care unit (MNCU). Health care providers and administrators were concerned about the potential for increased infections by the presence of mothers/surrogates in MNCU. We present post-hoc analysis of iKMC study to see effect of iKMC on neonatal sepsis.",
        " Methods ",
        "The intervention was KMC initiated immediately after birth and continued until discharge compared to conventional care with KMC initiated after meeting stability criteria. The outcomes were rates of neonatal sepsis, case fatality of neonatal sepsis, and profile of bacterial isolates.",
        " Results ",
        "1,602 newborns were randmoized to control and 1,609 to intervention group. Mean gestational age, mean birthweight, maternal and neonatal care related variables, which can be risk factors for neonatal sepsis, were similar in two groups.",
        "Suspected neonatal sepsis was 18% lower in the intervention group (22.9%) than the control group (27.8%) risk ratio (RR) 0.82 (CI 0.73\u20130.93) and sepsis-related mortality was 36% less in the intervention group (19.4%) than the control group (25.1%), RR 0.64 (CI 0.48\u2013 0.85); both were statistically significant. The intervention group had fewer Gram-negative isolates (9) than gram-positive isolates (16). While control group had more gram-negative isolates (18) than gram-positive (12).

These were complemented by 12 in-depth interviews to explore emerging patterns. Data was collected in 2021. We analysed data using descriptive statistics and thematic network analysis guided by theories of social practice.",
        " Results ",
        "In the structured interviews, most women (146/258, 57%) mentioned facilitators to facility births, mostly concerning safety benefits at health facilities. Nevertheless, only half of the women had given birth at a health facility (128/258), and 48% at home (125/258). Twenty-eight percent of the women mentioned barriers to facility births (73/258), mostly concerning geographical and financial constraints. When further probing into barriers during in-depth interviews, women added material prerequisites that need to be in place to access facility births but did not necessarily denote these as barriers. Despite facility births being officially free of charge, such prerequisites predominantly concerned direct and indirect payments. Accordingly, out-of-pocket payments were reported by 71% of women who had given birth at a health facility in the structured interviews (91/128), but only three of the 91 women who paid called such payment a barrier.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Ubiquitous direct and indirect payments suggest a phenomenon of commodification of facility births in rural Guinea-Bissau, such that individual purchasing power remains key to utilization. As the vast majority of our interviewees did not recognize such payments as barriers to care, we hypothesize that women do not feel entitled to free-of-charge facility births. Our findings raise important equity concerns, and call for integrating assessments of persistent barriers to care into routine monitoring of HSS initiatives.",

A lack of psychosocial support and extended family members being the key decision-makers also interfered with mothers\u2019 ability to EBF.

A webcam recorded video which researchers annotated to count breaths and track the presence of motion or caregiving. Markings on the belt aid visual counting and automated image-processing counting for reference comparison. Reference breath counting and PM signal comparison inform and optimize respiratory detection algorithms on the novel device.

        "In India, institutional delivery increased from 42% in 2005\u201306 to 90% in 2019\u201321. This has had a huge impact on reducing neonatal mortality rate (NMR) in the country, from 37 per 1,000 live births in 2005 to 22 in 2019. However, this progress is uneven. In states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which make up about one-fourth of the country population, NMR is more than 30 per 1,000 live births. Due to the insufficient and subpar public health system in these states, private health sectors are increasingly providing obstetric care and conducting C-section deliveries, which may have a negative impact on child health if the quality of service is compromised. The present study, therefore, examined the effect of private sector and C-section deliveries on NMR and early neonatal mortality rate (ENMR) in India and these two states.",

        "The Ministry of Health of Ethiopia is committed to intensifying efforts to increase access to treatment and prevention of new cases of obstetric fistula (OF) in order to eliminate obstetric fistula by 2025. This effort embarks on a two-pronged approach of prevention of new cases, and treatment of accrued survivors. However, the effort to decentralize and expand OF care faced an outstanding shortage of trained providers. To address this challenge, PIE and partners designed and implemented a competency-based training curriculum for mid-level providers (MLPs) on OF identification, diagnosis, and referral to treatment.",
        " Methods ",
        "Task shifting is one of the strategies the Ministry of Health has relied on in its commitment to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, including elimination of OF, since the era of the Millennium Development Goals. PIE supported the clinical skill training on OF to contribute to this task-shifting strategy. All sessions were hosted at Hamlin Centers, and senior OF consultants provided theoretical and clinical skills to the MLPs as per the curriculum. This survey covered the period: January 2017 to December 2021. Data for the survey was collected from DHIS2 and the project report.",
        " Results ",
        "PIE supported the training of 1,048 MLPs from 901 facilities in four regions for six years. Trained MLPs on OF have since then received the role of senior providers to successfully screen, confirm, and refer OF survivors. Following this task-shifting, trained MLPs have identified a total of 3,110 new OF suspected cases, of whom 2,903 (93%) were confirmed, 2,848 (98%) of those confirmed got referred by the providers, and 2,508 (88%) of the referred received treatment.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Task-shifting for OF care to MLPs at the primary health care level from the conventional, centralized, and senior-providers-based care is a feasible strategy that expands access to service by addressing gaps in equity in Ethiopia. This task-shifting strategy can be further scaled-up in the public health system in support of elimination of OF in Ethiopia and can be tested in low- and middle-income countries as a feasible strategy.",

This study assessed the completeness of delivering the recommended package of services for the first ANC visit and associated barriers and facilitators.",
        " Methods ",
        "A facility-based, mixed-methods study was conducted from January to \u2013March 2022. A two-stage cluster sampling was adopted; the first four districts were randomly selected. These are Gasabo, Rubavu, Rwamagana, and Ruhango, assuming one district per province. Next, two health centers with high ANC attendance were purposively selected from each district. A total of 2,242 records of ANC new registrant women were extracted from ANC registers from October to December 2021. We used the Rwandan Ministry of Health\u2019s ANC package checklist to measure completeness. Provision of ANC package was reported using frequencies and percentages. Using thematic analysis, barriers and facilitators were reported from 12 interviews conducted among health care providers.",

        "Generally, 23.5% of women received more than 90% of the full ANC package, 75.6% received 50%\u201389% of the full package, and 0.89% received less than 50% of the full package. Most services that were provided during the first ANC included the provision of iron supplements (94.9%), the provision of tetanus vaccine (93.4%), and HIV testing (88.8%). Of the 2,242 pregnant women, 47.9% were not screened for malnutrition; 41.1% were not screened for anemia; 39.7% did not receive deworming tablets, and 39.6% were not screened for urinary tract infection.

        "Although Rwanda has improved ANC coverage over time, the provision of recommended ANC packages to women attending their first ANC is uneven. A lack of health commodities and high workload are the major barriers to providing the recommended package of ANC services to women attending their first visit.

They feared to be blamed and held accountable for unfavorable outcomes, like perinatal death occurring during their shift irrespective of the circumstances. Mothers who did not abide by the tacit rules of the labor ward or behaved in an unpredictable way triggered this fear. This led to disrupted communication between midwifery care providers and mothers or their companions, often culminating in disrespectful care. Midwifery care providers felt unsupported and unprotected against social or legal reprimands in case of negative birthing outcomes.",

These outcomes are exacerbated by poor quality of care due to unskilled providers, lack of equipment, and inadequate basic amenities among other factors. SMGL 2.0, led by Pathfinder International in collaboration with PharmAccess Foundation and Kaduna State Government, is implementing a quality improvement (QI) program using the SafeCare methodology to ensure the delivery of quality-secured care for mothers and their newborns.",

Over the decades, Pakistan has managed to reduce the maternal mortality ratio from 276/100,000 (2006) to 186/100,000 (2018). However, subnational data shows variation being 140/100,000 in Punjab and 298/100,000 in Balochistan. Unfortunately, maternal mortality data is only available through population-based surveys and there is a dire need to have real-time data reporting with identification of the cause of mortality to guide programmatic decision making. The MPDSR system offers a workable solution and is being implemented in Pakistan since 2015.",
        " Methods ",
        "Under the MPDSR system implementation, national protocols and training package were developed in 2017. Maternal death reporting forms 1, 2, and 4 were adapted in Pakistan for reporting of maternal deaths at facility level. A mobile application was also developed for real-time and paperless reporting. Training of hospital teams including obstetricians, nurses, administrators, anesthetists, pediatricians and statisticians were conducted on the manual as well as on the mobile app (web-based tool) involving sixteen (16)public sector hospitals mainly tertiary care teaching hospitals. This tool was then revised and customized by the national TWG on Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health per professional feedback. Data is now being regularly received from the participating hospitals and uploaded to the MPDSR dashboard. Recently, the form on perinatal deaths including stillbirths and a response tracking sheet has also been added.",

The case summary along with challenges faced in the provision of care to the patient are also recorded. On the basis of this information, the maternal death review committees undertake the in-depth review, assign the cause of death and prepare response/ action plan for addressing the contributory factors. All of this information is available online through the dashboard linked to the mobile app. Since the introduction of the mobile app, the number of maternal deaths reported during 2021, 2022 and June 2023 are 87, 521 and 367, respectively.

When performed for appropriate indications, CS can be lifesaving for mothers and babies. However, the procedure has potential short- and long-term complications, with reported rates of CS-associated death in sub-Saharan Africa at 10.9 per 1,000 procedures. In many health facilities, decisions to perform CS are made by non-specialist doctors, without support from experienced obstetricians.

        "There was consensus on all but five cases. In 41.3% cases, CS was considered appropriate by all assessors. The panel concluded that the CS was necessary but performed too late in 8% cases. The decision to delivery interval was longer than two hours in 58.6% cases, including 16 cases where the main reason given for the CS was non-reassuring fetal status. In 10.3% cases, it was considered that due to the decision to delivery delay, further reassessment should have occurred. In 9.1%, it was considered that the CS was done too soon and those providing care could have waited longer or attempted augmentation of labor. The quality of some records resulted in insufficient information to make a full assessment in 21.8% of cases and in 11.5% the CS was considered inappropriate.",

        " Results ",
        "While the majority of FTMs interviewed sought multiple antenatal care visits, most did not recall receiving any counseling or information regarding PNC services. During pregnancy, most participants had no specific expectations of PNC due to lack of awareness of their existence and no previous birth experience. Almost all participants either did not consider seeking services postnatally, or only intended to seek PNC if there is a problem with mother or infant\u2019s health. Some FTMs were able to cite some specific complications that would motivate them to seek PNC, including excessive bleeding or pain. A key theme was lack of decision-making power by FTMs on where to deliver their child and whether to seek care, where the decision lay with the spouses or in-laws. Intentions during pregnancy directly influenced FTM\u2019s care-seeking behavior. Most FTMs receiving PNC solely sought it to address issues with their child\u2019s health. In a few instances, negative experiences during a facility delivery dissuaded FTMs from seeking additional PNC. Others wanted to seek PNC but did not know where to receive services or were prevented by their husband\u2019s families.",

CS rates were higher for the first birth (28%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.5), births in urban areas (32%; OR = 2.3), among mothers with more years of formal schooling (27%; OR = 1.9), and among those at high wealth strata (39%); OR = 2.2).",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The CS rate is high at the national level with variations across states and districts. With a wide public-private sector differential, it is imperative to devise an audit system of CS deliveries happening across the country. Tailored policies and regulations are needed to rationalize both elective and non-elective CS deliveries across the public and private sectors. Further research is needed to understand the factors underlying the high CS rates in private health facilities and to document the maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with CS, particularly non-indicated CS in India.",

        "Most surgical site infections (SSIs) after cesarean section (CS) occur following discharge of the mother from the hospital. In Kenya, poor follow-up of the client after she leaves the facility, lack of self-care awareness of post-CS women, and delayed care-seeking are major gaps in improving detection and timely management of SSIs, as well as in providing accurate estimation of SSI rates. The Johnson & Johnson-funded Obstetric Safe Surgery (OSS) project in Makueni County, Kenya, aimed to strengthen community-level follow-up of mothers and newborns at Day 7 and Day 30 post CS.",
        " Methods ",
        "The OSS program was implemented in five health facilities in Makueni County. Improving prevention and management of SSIs included active post-discharge tracking of clients coupled with standardized SSI management. Prior to discharge from the facility, clients were educated on post-CS self-care and warning signs. Community health volunteers reinforced the messages during household visits. Guided by standardized interview scripts, nurses conducted post-CS follow-up via telephone calls at Day 7 and Day 30 post-CS, with suspected cases of SSI evaluated at the health facility. From June 2021 to April 2022, post-CS SSI data were collected and uploaded to REDCap.",
        " Results ",
        "Baseline assessment, before the training and initiation of reporting tools, showed minimal data being collected on SSI. After the clinical training\u2014which included SSI screening, diagnosis, classification, and treatment per protocols\u2014new registers and reporting tools were introduced to capture and summarize data in the facilities. From June 2021 to April 2022, 2,793 CS were performed at the five facilities. Maternity nurses tracked 81% (2,265) and 73% (2,052) of mothers after CS at Day 7 and 30 days, respectively. Of the women tracked, 3.4 % and 2.4% were diagnosed with SSIs at day 7 and 30 respectively post discharge and managed at the facility.

Value-based health care (VBHC) could help improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes by promoting a data-driven and patient-centered approach. This presentation will highlight the impact, lessons, and feasibility of implementing VBHC for (MNCH) in low- and middle-income countries.",
        " Methods ",
        "Improving MNCH outcomes requires early and regular antenatal care, facility-based delivery, and postnatal care, tailored to the needs of individual mothers. Therefore, PharmAccess launched \u201cMomCare\u201d in Kenya in 2017, followed by Tanzania in 2019. Using the VBHC framework, MomCare incorporates three dimensions of care: (1) financing for a package of maternal care, (2) quality standards (SafeCare) for health care providers, and (3) actionable data to incentivize patient and provider behaviors. Mothers received a digital wallet (M-TIBA in Kenya) that entitled them to a care bundle encompassing the entire pregnancy journey including postnatal and neonatal care. Quality assessment was done through SafeCare during onboarding and repeated every year. Women consented to data collection through claims/data entry systems, SMS surveys, and call surveys. This allowed us to track utilization behavior, well-being, care experience, and outcomes throughout the journey, as well as risk mitigation by clinics. We implemented a pay-for-performance model and created dashboards with insights and benchmarking information. Clinics received actionable feedback including risk stratification and an overview of mothers to call to encourage facility-based delivery. Field teams supported clinics through periodic, data-based feedback sessions to stimulate continuous quality improvement.",

        "MomCare has been implemented in more than 70 clinics across Tanzania and Kenya, supporting more than 55,000 mothers. Throughout the program, we measured improved adherence to maternal care, better SafeCare scores, and improved risk mitigation. Providers actively engaged with data-based insights, actionable feedback, and the pay-for-performance system. We were able to identify unmet needs like mental health support for (teenage) mothers or breastfeeding support and adapted the care bundle accordingly.

Prevalence of stunting (>30%) increased from six to 12 months, while underweight (26%) and wasting (10%) remained consistent; regional differences were observed. Importantly, poor growth outcomes at six months were predictive of those at 12 months even when adjusted for key covariates (stunting RR=2.84, p<0.001; underweight RR=6.41, p<0.001; wasting RR=4.89, p<0.001).",

        "According to the World Health Organization, oxytocin is best given within one minute after birth, making timely administration of oxytocin the most important intervention to reduce postpartum hemorrhage. Despite these guidelines, health providers do not consistently adhere to this best practice. Psychological research supports that feedback can improve clinical performance. In low-resource settings, opportunities for regular supervision and mentoring may be limited, and alternative sources of feedback that are appropriate, cost-effective, and sustainable are critical.",
        " Methods ",
        "We developed a custom \u201coxytocin timer\u201d that reminds busy providers in low-resource facilities how long they have to administer oxytocin with beeps and a simple countdown display. The timer uses minimal energy and can be charged with solar power. Providers activate it through the touch of their elbow, making it easy to use when attending deliveries alone. The device also registers time of birth and has extra timer functions for other clinical tasks. Data dashboards could be built to give tailored performance feedback to clinicians and support performance improvement and also fill a gap in supervisory support.",
        " Results ",
        "Results from implementation research suggested high levels of adoption of the timer, with almost 80% of observed facilities having used the timer in the last 24 hours. Providers remarked on the feasibility of incorporating the timer into existing care and highlighted the utility of the timer in reminding them to apply oxytocin in a timely fashion. While the study design did not allow impact on provider behavior to be empirically assessed, qualitative feedback from providers suggested a shift in timely administration of oxytocin.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "Behavioral science can be used to conceptualize, design, and test innovative technologies that can shift clinical behavior with a focus on improving health outcomes. High rates of adoption and reported desirability of the timer in our study point to the importance of co-designing solutions together with providers so that providers derive utility from them and are motivated to use them consistently\u2014thus strengthening their potential for impact.",

Hence, strengthening providers\u2019 capacity for quality, survivor-centered post-GBV care is a pre-requisite for effective GBV response. In 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and partners adapted the WHO clinical guidelines on health care for women subjected to intimate partner violence or sexual violence for countrywide use. The MOMENTUM Country and Global Leadership Project (MCGL) became the first partner to train providers on the adapted clinical guidelines in Sokoto and Ebonyi States.",
        " Methods ",
        "The FMoH convened several meetings to adapt the guidelines to Nigeria\u2019s context, with key technical and financial support from WHO and MCGL. MCGL trained providers using the adapted National GBV clinical response guidelines and provided job aids, screening checklists, registers, counseling flipbooks, client booklets, and posters. These were followed with regular supportive supervision and mentoring using a structured supervision tool that assessed fidelity to first-line clinical response and regular health-facility register reviews for proper documentation. Gaps identified were addressed through facility-based, on-the-job training and coaching.",
        " Results ",
        "Nigeria\u2019s adaptation refocused on broader GBV service provision, a shift from WHO\u2019s women-focused guidelines. Of the 112 nurses/midwives trained, 105 (or 94%) initiated GBV services immediately after training. Six months after regular supervision and mentoring to strengthen skills and competencies further to screen, identify, and respond to GBV cases, all trained providers had started providing GBV services. Providers screened 89,582 clients, identified 2,092 cases, provided treatment to 1,799 clients, and referred 19 for non-clinical GBV services. This activity, therefore, ensured that 100% of MCGL-supported health facilities now provide GBV survivor-centered services, compared to 0.4% before the MCGL program as measured by formative assessment.",

Although participants considered PPH an obstetric emergency, knowledge about PPH varied among different cadres of health workers. The subjective nature of visual estimation of blood loss was recognized as the key barrier to early detection of PPH.

        "We conducted a mixed-method systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Global Health databases from the database inception to September 2022. We included qualitative and quantitative studies that explored views of women, health care providers, community members, and other relevant policy-makers about calcium supplementation during pregnancy. We used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation of Behavior (COM-B) models to identify barriers and facilitators of calcium supplementation implementation to prevent pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. We used the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess the confidence of each qualitative finding and mapped quantitative findings to qualitative themes.",

        "We included 16 studies. There was limited knowledge about calcium-containing supplements and pre-eclampsia. Fears and experiences of side effects, varying tablet preferences, dosing, and challenges due to routine were the barriers to calcium supplement use for women. Information regarding pre-eclampsia and the safety of calcium supplementation from reliable sources, options of daily doses, reminders and support from family and community may help increase women\u2019s calcium uptake. Early initiation of antenatal contacts and the provision of calcium supplements at no cost might increase adherence to calcium supplement uptake. Consistent messages, training, and ensuring that an adequate number of human resources and calcium dosage forms could encourage the providers\u2019 use of calcium supplements.",

To address this, South Africa\u2019s National Department of Health launched a multi-partner, facility-based, quality improvement (QI) program (2018\u20132022), called Mphatlalatsane, in 21 resource-constrained facilities across three high-burden provinces. The program\u2019s aim was to work with facility staff to establish QI teams. These teams identified key areas to improve maternal and newborn health (MNH) services, then developed and implemented the QI plans (QIPs).",
        " Methods ",
        "An evaluation was conducted (2020\u20132022), assessing Mphatlalatsane\u2019s impact on maternal and neonatal mortality, still births, maternal experiences of care, quality of care, and implementation processes to inform the replication of effective QIPs. We report the results from the qualitative evaluation of facility-level implementation processes. We purposively selected 14 of the 21 facilities. Three rounds of interviews were conducted (May 2021\u2013September 2022) with QI team leaders and members (health care workers in the participating facilities); regular debriefings were conducted with QI advisors (technical experts supporting the QI teams); and program documentation was reviewed. All data were thematically analyzed.",
        " Results ",
        "Across the facilities, 28 effective QIPs were developed and sustained, addressing a range of MNH services: promoting early booking of antenatal care visits (five facilities); triaging patients in labor admission and antenatal care high-risk clinics (six facilities); improving completeness of records such as the partogram (five facilities); TB screening of antenatal care patients (three facilities); and QIPs implemented in only one facility (e.g., postpartum family planning). Key components in successful implementation were: involving community health workers and traditional practitioners when needed; upskilling staff to use standard tools and protocols; and developing user-friendly tools to monitor effectiveness. The team leader and QI advisor were key drivers for successful teams. Staff shortages and attrition, and the high-pressured environment of MNH services were barriers to successful implementation.",

Lack or stock-outs of essential EmONC drugs such as antibiotics and anticonvulsants are widespread at higher proportions and so are stock-outs of basic EmONC equipment such as the neonatal resuscitation kit. Also, while all comprehensive EmONC facilities are functional, 75% of basic EmONC facilities are not. The vast majority of delivery professionals have not yet managed a maternal or neonatal complication including the deadliest complications such as hemorrhage, eclampsia, breech delivery, or neonatal asphyxia. Mother exit interviews revealed that 8% of pregnant women waste 30 minutes on average trying to find the maternity ward and further wait another 11 to 30 minutes to be seen by delivery personnel.

        "A restrictive perception and understanding of sexual and reproductive health by the populations interviewed in the three regions: Gender mainstreaming in sexual and reproductive health means that men have the final say in health decisions for their families. Most women either lack information or neglect health issues. The late use of prenatal health services is the result of certain cultural myths. The negative influence of certain religions on the adoption of modern family planning methods by women rather than men. The poor reception and stigmatizing behavior by some health care providers limits adolescents\u2019 access to sexual or reproductive\u00a0health services adapted to\u00a0the\u00a0needs of\u00a0young people.",

The quality of care and monitoring of mothers and newborns during childbirth is crucial to reducing these deaths. Our study aimed to identify problems in the care provided between the onset of labor and immediately after delivery, to suggest levers for action to improve the quality of care and reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in Benin hospitals.",
        " Methods ",
        "We conducted a qualitative study in four hospitals in Benin. Data were collected from health care providers, women in childbirth, birth attendants and caregivers through 63 in-depth interviews, eight observations, and four focus groups. Participants were selected on the basis of reasoned choice. A thematic content analysis was carried out using the World Health Organization\u2019s guide to the organization of childbirth health care as a theoretical framework.",
        " Results ",
        "The majority of women are ineffectively accompanied during labor. On the one hand, their caregivers provide little of the recommended support, such as breathing or relaxation exercises during contractions. They sometimes indulge in potentially dangerous practices, such as providing the woman with pharmacopoeia products (herbal teas, roots, etc.) to speed up labor. These practices are linked to a lack of knowledge of actually support the woman, but also to the fear of cesarean section, high expenses, and sometimes to the lack of \u201cuser- friendly\u201d hospital environment. On the other hand, vital parameters (contractions, fetal heart rate) are not systematically monitored by health care workers. This is due to the high workload, lack of equipment, and sub-optimal organization.",
        " Conclusions ",
        "The current context of childbirth in the hospitals studied does not always guarantee favorable maternal and fetal outcomes. Challenges are encountered by families and providers alike. Based on these results, simple interventions (teaching families to better support women during childbirth) can help reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in Benin.",
