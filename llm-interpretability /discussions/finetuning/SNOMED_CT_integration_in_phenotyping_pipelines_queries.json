        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Clinical Informatics Specialist to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.\n                You are responsible for understanding the topic SNOMED CT integration in phenotyping pipelines in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.\n                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on SNOMED CT integration in phenotyping pipelines to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.\n                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on SNOMED CT integration in phenotyping pipelines. Include both general queries about SNOMED CT integration in phenotyping pipelines and queries that specifically relate SNOMED CT integration in phenotyping pipelines to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.\n                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on SNOMED CT integration in phenotyping pipelines (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?\n\nClinical Informatics Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To effectively explore the integration of SNOMED CT in phenotyping pipelines and its relevance to LLM interpretability, I will craft search queries that cover both general aspects and specific intersections with LLMs, phenotype definitions, clinical applications, and clinician trust. Here are the queries I propose:\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"SNOMED CT integration in phenotyping pipelines\",\n    \"SNOMED CT and electronic phenotype definition\",\n    \"LLM interpretability in electronic phenotyping with SNOMED CT\",\n    \"Clinical applications of SNOMED CT in phenotyping and LLMs\",\n    \"Building clinician trust through SNOMED CT-based phenotype definitions\"\n]\n```\n\nThese queries are designed to capture a broad spectrum of literature, from foundational concepts of SNOMED CT integration to its specific applications in enhancing LLM interpretability and fostering clinician trust. By using these queries, we aim to gather comprehensive insights into how SNOMED CT can be effectively utilized within phenotyping pipelines, particularly in the context of developing a transparent and clinically relevant interpretability tool."
