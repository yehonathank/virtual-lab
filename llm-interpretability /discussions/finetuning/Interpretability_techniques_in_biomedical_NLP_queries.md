## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Computational Linguist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP. Include both general queries about Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP and queries that specifically relate Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Computational Linguist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Computational Linguist

To effectively gather relevant literature on interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP, particularly in the context of LLM interpretability for electronic phenotype definitions, I propose the following search queries. These queries are designed to cover both general interpretability techniques and their specific applications in clinical settings, including the integration of SNOMED CT and visual elements to enhance clinician trust.

```python
queries = [
    "interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP",
    "LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions",
    "interpretability in clinical NLP applications",
    "SNOMED CT integration for LLM interpretability",
    "visual interpretability tools for clinician trust in NLP models"
]
```

These queries aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this area, focusing on the intersection of interpretability, clinical applications, and the use of visual aids to foster trust.
