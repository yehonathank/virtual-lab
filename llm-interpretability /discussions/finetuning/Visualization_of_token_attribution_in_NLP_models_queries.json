        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Data Visualization Expert to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.\n                You are responsible for understanding the topic Visualization of token attribution in NLP models in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.\n                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Visualization of token attribution in NLP models to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.\n                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Visualization of token attribution in NLP models. Include both general queries about Visualization of token attribution in NLP models and queries that specifically relate Visualization of token attribution in NLP models to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.\n                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Visualization of token attribution in NLP models (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?\n\nData Visualization Expert, please provide your response to the agenda."

These queries are designed to cover both general aspects of token attribution visualization and its specific applications in clinical settings. Here are the queries in Python syntax:\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"Visualization of token attribution in NLP models\",\n    \"Token attribution visualization for LLM interpretability\",\n    \"NLP token attribution in electronic phenotype definitions\",\n    \"Visualization techniques for clinical NLP model interpretability\",\n    \"Building clinician trust through visualization of LLM decisions in healthcare\"\n]\n```\n\nThese queries aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape, focusing on both the technical aspects of visualization and the practical implications for clinical applications. By exploring these topics, we can better understand how to develop a tool that is both transparent and trustworthy for clinicians working with LLMs in electronic phenotype definitions."
