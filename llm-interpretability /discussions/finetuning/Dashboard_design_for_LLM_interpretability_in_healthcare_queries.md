## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Data Visualization Expert to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Dashboard design for LLM interpretability in healthcare in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Dashboard design for LLM interpretability in healthcare to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Dashboard design for LLM interpretability in healthcare. Include both general queries about Dashboard design for LLM interpretability in healthcare and queries that specifically relate Dashboard design for LLM interpretability in healthcare to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Dashboard design for LLM interpretability in healthcare (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Data Visualization Expert

To effectively identify relevant literature on Dashboard design for LLM interpretability in healthcare, I will create a series of search queries that encompass both general and specific aspects of the topic. These queries will help in gathering comprehensive insights into the design and application of dashboards for LLM interpretability, particularly in the context of electronic phenotype definitions and clinician trust. Here are the queries in Python syntax:

```python
search_queries = [
    "Dashboard design for LLM interpretability in healthcare",
    "LLM interpretability and electronic phenotype definition in clinical settings",
    "Visual analytics for LLM-based electronic phenotype definitions",
    "Integrating SNOMED CT in LLM interpretability dashboards for healthcare",
    "Building clinician trust through visual tools for LLM interpretability"
]
```

These queries are designed to cover a broad spectrum of relevant topics, including general dashboard design for LLM interpretability, specific applications in electronic phenotype definitions, the integration of SNOMED CT for enhanced reasoning, and the role of visual tools in fostering clinician trust. By using these queries, we can gather a diverse range of literature that will inform the development of a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
