These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems\u2014patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients\u2014and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge.

At present, anxiety disorders are regarded as the most widespread psychiatric disorders globally. Medication and different types of psychotherapies are employed as the primary therapeutic modalities in clinical practice for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, combining these two approaches is known to yield more significant benefits than medication alone. Nevertheless, there is a lack of resources and a limited availability of psychotherapy options in underdeveloped areas. Psychotherapy methods encompass relaxation techniques, controlled breathing exercises, visualization exercises, controlled exposure exercises, and cognitive interventions such as challenging negative thoughts. These methods are vital in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but executing them proficiently can be demanding. Moreover, individuals with distinct anxiety disorders are prescribed medications that may cause withdrawal symptoms in some instances. Additionally, there is inadequate availability of face-to-face psychotherapy and a restricted capacity to predict and monitor the health, behavioral, and environmental aspects of individuals with anxiety disorders during the initial phases. In recent years, there has been notable progress in developing and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) based applications and environments to improve the precision and sensitivity of diagnosing and treating various categories of anxiety disorders. As a result, this study aims to establish the efficacy of AI-enabled environments in addressing the existing challenges in managing anxiety disorders, reducing reliance on medication, and investigating the potential advantages, issues, and opportunities of integrating AI-assisted healthcare for anxiety disorders and enabling personalized therapy.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 6157254\n\nTitle = Proceedings of the 4th IPLeiria\u2019s International Health Congress\n\n\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 10956028\n\nTitle = GaNDLF: the generally nuanced deep learning framework for scalable end-to-end clinical workflows\n\nDeep Learning (DL) has the potential to optimize machine learning in both the scientific and clinical communities. However, greater expertise is required to develop DL algorithms, and the variability of implementations hinders their reproducibility, translation, and deployment. Here we present the community-driven Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework (GaNDLF), with the goal of lowering these barriers. GaNDLF makes the mechanism of DL development, training, and inference more stable, reproducible, interpretable, and scalable, without requiring an extensive technical background. GaNDLF aims to provide an end-to-end solution for all DL-related tasks in computational precision medicine. We demonstrate the ability of GaNDLF to analyze both radiology and histology images, with built-in support for k-fold cross-validation, data augmentation, multiple modalities and output classes. Our quantitative performance evaluation on numerous use cases, anatomies, and computational tasks supports GaNDLF as a robust application framework for deployment in clinical workflows.\n\nThe increasing complexity of the implementation and operation of deep learning techniques hinders their reproducibility and deployment at scale, especially in healthcare. Pati and colleagues introduce a deep learning framework to analyse healthcare data without requiring extensive computational experience, facilitating the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical workflows.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 10956174\n\nTitle = Proceedings of the 2023 International Maternal Newborn Health Conference\n\n\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 3 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles in LLM interpretability\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 11605263\n\nTitle = Economics and Equity of Large Language Models: Health Care Perspective\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit noteworthy capabilities across a spectrum of areas, including emerging proficiencies across the health care continuum. Successful LLM implementation and adoption depend on digital readiness, modern infrastructure, a trained workforce, privacy, and an ethical regulatory landscape. These factors can vary significantly across health care ecosystems, dictating the choice of a particular LLM implementation pathway. This perspective discusses 3 LLM implementation pathways\u2014training from scratch pathway (TSP), fine-tuned pathway (FTP), and out-of-the-box pathway (OBP)\u2014as potential onboarding points for health systems while facilitating equitable adoption. The choice of a particular pathway is governed by needs as well as affordability. Therefore, the risks, benefits, and economics of these pathways across 4 major cloud service providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle) are presented. While cost comparisons, such as on-demand and spot pricing across the cloud service providers for the 3 pathways, are presented for completeness, the usefulness of managed services and cloud enterprise tools is elucidated. Managed services can complement the traditional workforce and expertise, while enterprise tools, such as federated learning, can overcome sample size challenges when implementing LLMs using health care data. Of the 3 pathways, TSP is expected to be the most resource-intensive regarding infrastructure and workforce while providing maximum customization, enhanced transparency, and performance. Because TSP trains the LLM using enterprise health care data, it is expected to harness the digital signatures of the population served by the health care system with the potential to impact outcomes. The use of pretrained models in FTP is a limitation. It may impact its performance because the training data used in the pretrained model may have hidden bias and may not necessarily be health care\u2013related. However, FTP provides a balance between customization, cost, and performance. While OBP can be rapidly deployed, it provides minimal customization and transparency without guaranteeing long-term availability. OBP may also present challenges in interfacing seamlessly with downstream applications in health care settings with variations in pricing and use over time. Lack of customization in OBP can significantly limit its ability to impact outcomes. Finally, potential applications of LLMs in health care, including conversational artificial intelligence, chatbots, summarization, and machine translation, are highlighted. While the 3 implementation pathways discussed in this perspective have the potential to facilitate equitable adoption and democratization of LLMs, transitions between them may be necessary as the needs of health systems evolve. Understanding the economics and trade-offs of these onboarding pathways can guide their strategic adoption and demonstrate value while impacting health care outcomes favorably.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11745858\n\nTitle = Application of large language models in disease diagnosis and treatment\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, and Qwen are emerging as transformative technologies for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. With their exceptional long-context reasoning capabilities, LLMs are proficient in clinically relevant tasks, particularly in medical text analysis and interactive dialogue. They can enhance diagnostic accuracy by processing vast amounts of patient data and medical literature and have demonstrated their utility in diagnosing common diseases and facilitating the identification of rare diseases by recognizing subtle patterns in symptoms and test results. Building on their image-recognition abilities, multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) show promising potential for diagnosis based on radiography, chest computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), and common pathological images. These models can also assist in treatment planning by suggesting evidence-based interventions and improving clinical decision support systems through integrated analysis of patient records. Despite these promising developments, significant challenges persist regarding the use of LLMs in medicine, including concerns regarding algorithmic bias, the potential for hallucinations, and the need for rigorous clinical validation. Ethical considerations also underscore the importance of maintaining the function of supervision in clinical practice. This paper highlights the rapid advancements in research on the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of LLMs across different medical disciplines and emphasizes the importance of policymaking, ethical supervision, and multidisciplinary collaboration in promoting more effective and safer clinical applications of LLMs. Future directions include the integration of proprietary clinical knowledge, the investigation of open-source and customized models, and the evaluation of real-time effects in clinical diagnosis and treatment practices.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 11208837\n\nTitle = Evaluating the Prevalence of Burnout Among Health Care Professionals Related to Electronic Health Record Use: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\n\nBurnout among health care professionals is a significant concern, with detrimental effects on health care service quality and patient outcomes. The use of the electronic health record (EHR) system has been identified as a significant contributor to burnout among health care professionals.\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the prevalence of burnout among health care professionals associated with the use of the EHR system, thereby providing evidence to improve health information systems and develop strategies to measure and mitigate burnout.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for English-language peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2022. Two independent reviewers applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, and study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses were performed using R (version 4.1.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing), with EndNote X7 (Clarivate) for reference management.\n\nThe review included 32 cross-sectional studies and 5 case-control studies with a total of 66,556 participants, mainly physicians and registered nurses. The pooled prevalence of burnout among health care professionals in cross-sectional studies was 40.4% (95% CI 37.5%-43.2%). Case-control studies indicated a higher likelihood of burnout among health care professionals who spent more time on EHR-related tasks outside work (odds ratio 2.43, 95% CI 2.31-2.57).\n\nThe findings highlight the association between the increased use of the EHR system and burnout among health care professionals. Potential solutions include optimizing EHR systems, implementing automated dictation or note-taking, employing scribes to reduce documentation burden, and leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance EHR system efficiency and reduce the risk of burnout.\n\nPROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42021281173; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021281173\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 2 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles in phenotype definition\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 6157254\n\nTitle = Proceedings of the 4th IPLeiria\u2019s International Health Congress\n\n\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 5391321\n\nTitle = Abstracts from the 2017 Society of General Internal Medicine Annual Meeting\n\n\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n\n\nHere are the top 5 articles on PubMed Central for the query \"Customizing interpretability interfaces for clinician roles in clinical applications\":\n\n[begin paper 1]\n\nPMCID = 5938574\n\nTitle = Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine\n\nDeep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features.
