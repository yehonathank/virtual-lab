This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Computational Linguist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP. Include both general queries about Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP and queries that specifically relate Interpretability techniques in biomedical NLP to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the PMCIDs and titles of the papers you wish to fine-tune yourself on (as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as double-quoted string)?

Computational Linguist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Computational Linguist

It seems that no articles were found for the specific queries I ran on PubMed Central. This might be due to the specificity of the search terms or the current availability of indexed articles on these topics. 

To proceed, I suggest refining the search queries to be broader or using alternative keywords that might capture relevant literature. Here are some refined queries that could potentially yield better results:

1. "Interpretability in biomedical natural language processing"
2. "Large language models interpretability in healthcare"
3. "Electronic phenotype definition and NLP"
4. "Clinical NLP applications and interpretability"
5. "Building clinician trust with NLP tools"

Would you like me to run these refined queries, or do you have any other suggestions for search terms?
