        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Clinical Informatics Specialist to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.\n                You are responsible for understanding the topic Mapping free-text clinical concepts to standardized vocabularies in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.\n                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Mapping free-text clinical concepts to standardized vocabularies to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.\n                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Mapping free-text clinical concepts to standardized vocabularies. Include both general queries about Mapping free-text clinical concepts to standardized vocabularies and queries that specifically relate Mapping free-text clinical concepts to standardized vocabularies to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.\n                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Mapping free-text clinical concepts to standardized vocabularies (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?\n\nClinical Informatics Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

These queries are designed to cover both general aspects and specific intersections with LLMs, phenotype definitions, and clinical applications:\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"Mapping free-text clinical concepts to standardized vocabularies\",\n    \"LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definition\",\n    \"Integrating SNOMED CT with LLMs for clinical concept mapping\",\n    \"Visual interpretability tools for electronic health records\",\n    \"Building clinician trust in LLM-based phenotype extraction\"\n]\n```\n\nThese queries aim to gather comprehensive insights into the current state of research and methodologies, focusing on the integration of standardized vocabularies like SNOMED CT, the role of visual tools in enhancing interpretability, and fostering clinician trust in LLM applications."
