## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Data Visualization Expert to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Human-AI interaction through visual explanation tools in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Human-AI interaction through visual explanation tools to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Human-AI interaction through visual explanation tools. Include both general queries about Human-AI interaction through visual explanation tools and queries that specifically relate Human-AI interaction through visual explanation tools to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Human-AI interaction through visual explanation tools (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Data Visualization Expert

To identify relevant literature on Human-AI interaction through visual explanation tools, particularly in the context of LLM interpretability for electronic phenotype definitions, I propose the following search queries. These queries are designed to cover both general aspects of Human-AI interaction and specific applications in clinical settings:

```python
queries = [
    "Human-AI interaction visual explanation tools",
    "LLM interpretability in clinical applications",
    "visual explanation tools for electronic phenotype definition",
    "SNOMED CT integration in AI interpretability",
    "building clinician trust through AI visualizations"
]
```

These queries aim to capture a broad spectrum of research, from foundational concepts in Human-AI interaction and visual explanation tools to specific applications involving LLMs, phenotype definitions, and clinical trust-building. By exploring these areas, we can gather insights and methodologies that will inform the development of a transparent and clinically grounded interpretability tool.
