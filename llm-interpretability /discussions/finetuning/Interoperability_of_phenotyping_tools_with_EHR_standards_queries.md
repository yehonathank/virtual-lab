This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Clinical Informatics Specialist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic Interoperability of phenotyping tools with EHR standards in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Interoperability of phenotyping tools with EHR standards to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Interoperability of phenotyping tools with EHR standards. Include both general queries about Interoperability of phenotyping tools with EHR standards and queries that specifically relate Interoperability of phenotyping tools with EHR standards to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Interoperability of phenotyping tools with EHR standards (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Clinical Informatics Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Clinical Informatics Specialist

To effectively gather relevant literature on the interoperability of phenotyping tools with EHR standards, particularly in the context of LLM interpretability and electronic phenotype definitions, I propose the following search queries. These queries are designed to cover both general interoperability topics and specific intersections with LLMs, clinical applications, and clinician trust.

```python
search_queries = [
    "Interoperability of phenotyping tools with EHR standards",
    "LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions and EHR interoperability",
    "Integrating SNOMED CT for phenotype extraction and EHR interoperability",
    "Visual interpretability tools for electronic phenotyping and clinician trust",
    "Machine learning approaches to enhance EHR interoperability in phenotype definitions"
]
```

These queries aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research and development in this area, focusing on the integration of LLMs with EHR systems, the role of standardized terminologies like SNOMED CT, and the importance of visual tools in fostering clinician trust.
