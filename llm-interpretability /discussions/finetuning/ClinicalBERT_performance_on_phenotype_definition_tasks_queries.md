## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Computational Linguist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. To develop a tool for LLM interpretability in electronic phenotype definitions, we will adopt a machine learning approach, leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Our focus will be on integrating SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, while incorporating visual elements to build clinician trust.
                You are responsible for understanding the topic ClinicalBERT performance on phenotype definition tasks in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline for electronic phenotype definition.
                You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on ClinicalBERT performance on phenotype definition tasks to improve your ability to contribute effectively to building a transparent, clinically grounded, and visually intuitive interpretability tool.
                Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on ClinicalBERT performance on phenotype definition tasks. Include both general queries about ClinicalBERT performance on phenotype definition tasks and queries that specifically relate ClinicalBERT performance on phenotype definition tasks to LLM interpretability, phenotype definition, clinical applications, and clinician trust.
                Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on ClinicalBERT performance on phenotype definition tasks (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Computational Linguist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Computational Linguist

To identify relevant literature on ClinicalBERT performance on phenotype definition tasks, especially in the context of designing an LLM-based interpretability pipeline, I have crafted a series of search queries. These queries aim to cover both general aspects of ClinicalBERT's performance and its specific applications in LLM interpretability, clinical applications, and building clinician trust. Here are the queries in Python syntax:

```python
queries = [
    "ClinicalBERT performance on electronic phenotype definition",
    "ClinicalBERT interpretability in phenotype definition tasks",
    "LLM interpretability and ClinicalBERT in clinical phenotype applications",
    "Building clinician trust with ClinicalBERT in phenotype definitions",
    "Integrating SNOMED CT with ClinicalBERT for phenotype definition"
]
```

These queries are designed to extract comprehensive insights into how ClinicalBERT is utilized in phenotype definition tasks, its interpretability, and how it can be integrated into a broader framework that includes SNOMED CT to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations. Additionally, they focus on the visual and trust-building aspects necessary for clinician acceptance and effective use.
