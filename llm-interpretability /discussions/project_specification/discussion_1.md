Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we begin this meeting, I want to emphasize the significance and potential impact of our research on LLM interpretability within the biomedical domain. Our goal is to develop a tool that not only improves the interpretability of large language models but also integrates a visual component to enhance clinician trust.

To guide our discussion, let's focus on a few key areas:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: Should we leverage machine learning techniques, or is there a more straightforward computational approach that could suffice for interpretability in this context?

2. **Use of Existing Libraries**: Open source libraries could provide a foundation to build upon, saving time and resources. Are there libraries that align well with our goals, or should we focus on creating custom solutions that might be more tailored to our specific needs?

3. **Algorithm Design**: If we choose to create our algorithms, what innovative approaches can we take to ensure they are effective in reducing hallucinations and enhancing reasoning?

4. **Integration with SNOMED**: The SNOMED database is a critical resource. How can we best utilize it to ensure our tool promotes valid reasoning and supports clinicians in making informed decisions?

I encourage each team member to consider these points and provide their expertise. Your insights will be invaluable in shaping the direction of our project. Let's start with the Computational Linguist. Please share your thoughts.

## User

Computational Linguist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Linguist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts regarding the agenda items:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I believe a machine learning approach is essential in our case. LLMs inherently involve complex patterns that are best understood through machine learning techniques. These methods can aid in capturing the nuanced linguistic patterns needed for reliable phenotype definitions.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries**: I recommend leveraging open source interpretability libraries initially. Libraries like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and Captum (a PyTorch library for model interpretability) could be particularly valuable. They offer robust frameworks that we can adapt to suit our specific needs, saving us considerable time in development.

3. **Algorithm Design**: If we choose to create our algorithms, they should focus on enhancing transparency through clear, linguistically grounded explanations. We might explore hybrid approaches that combine rule-based systems with machine learning to ensure robustness.

4. **Integration with SNOMED**: The SNOMED database can be pivotal in promoting a valid chain of thought. By mapping LLM outputs to SNOMED concepts, we can ensure that generated phenotypes are accurate and clinically relevant. This connection could also help in reducing hallucinations by providing a reference point for validation.

I'm eager to hear what the Biomedical Informatics Specialist has to say next.

Biomedical Informatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Biomedical Informatics Specialist

Thank you, Computational Linguist, for your insights. Here are my thoughts on the agenda items from a biomedical informatics perspective:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I agree that a machine learning approach is beneficial, particularly for handling the complexity and volume of data involved in phenotype definitions. However, I would like to emphasize the importance of ensuring these machine learning models align with clinical standards and real-world applicability.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries**: I support using open source interpretability libraries as a starting point. In addition to LIME, SHAP, and Captum, we should consider the InterpretML library, which is designed specifically for interpretability and could integrate well with clinical data.

3. **Algorithm Design**: If we decide to create custom algorithms, we need to focus on integrating clinical ontologies and standards from the outset. This integration will help ensure that our algorithms are not only interpretative but also clinically meaningful and compliant with standards such as SNOMED.

4. **Integration with SNOMED**: Utilizing SNOMED effectively will be crucial. We should aim to embed SNOMED concepts directly within the model's interpretability framework, allowing clinicians to see how model outputs map directly to recognized medical standards. This approach will help increase confidence in the model's outputs by backing them with well-established clinical concepts.

Overall, ensuring that our models are both interpretable and clinically relevant should be our primary focus. I'm looking forward to hearing from the Data Visualization Expert next.

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Data Visualization Expert

Thank you, Biomedical Informatics Specialist. Here are my thoughts on the agenda items from a data visualization standpoint:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I am in agreement with pursuing a machine learning approach, as it aligns with our goal to interpret complex LLM outputs. However, the visualization component is equally critical in translating these outputs into formats that clinicians can easily understand and trust.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries**: Leveraging open source libraries is a wise strategy. Tools like SHAP and LIME offer basic visualization capabilities that can be adapted for clinical use. But we need to go a step further by creating visual representations that are specifically tailored to clinical interpretability, possibly extending these libraries with custom visualization modules.

3. **Algorithm Design**: Should we venture into creating our algorithms, it will be essential to design them with visualization in mind. This means ensuring that whatever interpretability metrics or models we use, they must be easily transformable into visual formats. Integrating user feedback loops into our design process could also ensure that our visualizations remain intuitive and useful for clinicians.

4. **Integration with SNOMED**: SNOMED can be visually represented in a way that helps clinicians grasp the connections between model outputs and established medical standards. Interactive visual maps or networks that link LLM outputs to SNOMED concepts could be developed to enhance understanding and trust.

In summary, successfully communicating the outputs of LLMs through clear, informative visualizations will be key to gaining clinician trust. I look forward to the insights from the Scientific Critic.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you, Data Visualization Expert. Here are my critical reflections on the discussion so far:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: While the consensus seems to favor a machine learning approach, I would advise caution. It's crucial to ensure that the models we develop are interpretable and transparent, especially in a clinical setting. Over-reliance on complex machine learning models can sometimes obscure understanding rather than enhance it. We should also consider complementary methods such as rule-based systems to ensure transparency and simplicity when possible.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries**: Utilizing existing libraries like LIME, SHAP, Captum, and InterpretML is logical, but we must critically assess their suitability for clinical data. These tools must be rigorously validated in the context of electronic phenotype definitions to ensure their outputs are trustworthy. It is essential to document any adaptations we make and provide a clear rationale for their use in our specific context.

3. **Algorithm Design**: If we decide to develop algorithms from scratch, they must be designed with an emphasis on validation and verification. This includes clear metrics for success and fail-safes to ensure that the models do not produce misleading results. Any new algorithms should be subjected to rigorous testing against a robust dataset, possibly involving blinded clinical trials to assess their interpretability and usefulness in real-world scenarios.

4. **Integration with SNOMED**: While integrating SNOMED is an excellent idea for promoting valid reasoning, we must ensure that it is done systematically and transparently. The mappings between LLM outputs and SNOMED concepts need to be clear and reproducible, and we should provide a user-friendly interface for clinicians to verify these connections easily.

In conclusion, we should strive for a balance between leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and maintaining transparency and simplicity in our results. I look forward to seeing how the Principal Investigator synthesizes these points to guide our next steps.

## User

This concludes round 1 of 3 of discussion. Principal Investigator, please synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Thank you all for your insightful contributions. Let's synthesize the discussion points and make some preliminary decisions based on the input provided:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: There is a clear consensus that a machine learning approach is essential for managing the complexity of LLM outputs. However, the Scientific Critic's point about ensuring transparency and considering complementary methods like rule-based systems is vital. We should aim for a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of machine learning while maintaining clarity and transparency.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries**: The team has recommended leveraging existing libraries such as LIME, SHAP, Captum, and InterpretML. This approach will allow us to build on established frameworks, saving time and resources. However, we must carefully evaluate these tools' efficacy in a clinical context and document any modifications.

3. **Algorithm Design**: If we develop new algorithms, they should prioritize transparency and include rigorous validation processes. Integrating user feedback, especially from clinicians, during development could ensure our tools remain useful and intuitive. We should also establish clear success metrics for any new algorithms developed.

4. **Integration with SNOMED**: The potential of SNOMED to enhance the validity of model outputs was acknowledged. Developing interactive visualizations that map LLM outputs directly to SNOMED concepts could be highly beneficial. We need to ensure these mappings are systematic and user-friendly.

**Decisions and Follow-up Questions:**
- We will adopt a hybrid machine learning approach, utilizing both ML techniques and rule-based systems where appropriate.
- We will start by integrating existing libraries and evaluate their performance in our context.
- For developing new algorithms, let’s explore how we can incorporate direct clinician feedback into the design process. Could the Computational Linguist and Data Visualization Expert collaborate to propose a method for this?
- Regarding SNOMED integration, can the Biomedical Informatics Specialist and Data Visualization Expert outline a preliminary design for an interactive visualization that links LLM outputs with SNOMED concepts?

I invite each team member to consider these decisions and questions. In the next round, let's dive deeper into how we might incorporate clinician feedback and develop our visualization strategy.

## Computational Linguist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts regarding the follow-up questions and decisions made:

1. **Incorporating Clinician Feedback**: Collaborating with the Data Visualization Expert, I propose we develop a feedback loop that involves clinicians in testing prototype versions of our interpretability tools. This approach would involve presenting clinicians with outputs and visualizations, gathering their insights on clarity and usefulness, and iterating on the design based on their feedback. A series of workshops or focus groups could be instrumental here.

2. **Hybrid Approach**: The decision to pursue a hybrid approach strikes a balance between complexity and simplicity. We can incorporate rule-based systems to handle straightforward cases or provide baseline interpretations, enhancing the overall transparency of the tool.

3. **Use of Existing Libraries**: I fully support evaluating and modifying existing libraries to suit our needs. In our context, we should prioritize modifications that allow these tools to handle medical language and terminologies effectively. This might involve integrating SNOMED concepts directly into the interpretation process.

4. **SNOMED Integration**: For the preliminary design of interactive visualizations linking LLM outputs with SNOMED concepts, I suggest we ensure that these visualizations not only map outputs to SNOMED concepts but also provide contextual information about these concepts. This could help clinicians understand the relevance and implications of the model outputs.

I’m eager to hear how the Data Visualization Expert plans to collaborate on this.

Biomedical Informatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Biomedical Informatics Specialist

Thank you, Computational Linguist. I appreciate your insights. Here are my thoughts on the current discussion:

1. **Clinician Feedback Integration**: I strongly support the idea of involving clinicians early and throughout our development process. Their feedback will be invaluable in ensuring that our interpretability tools meet practical needs. We could design a user interface mockup or a beta version of the tool specifically for clinician testing, gradually refining it based on their input.

2. **Hybrid Approach**: The combination of machine learning and rule-based systems is a prudent choice. This allows us to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches, ensuring robustness and interpretability. It’s crucial, however, that any rule-based systems we implement are flexible and can be updated easily as new clinical information becomes available.

3. **Use of Existing Libraries**: As we evaluate these libraries, we should focus on their capability to handle structured medical data and integrate seamlessly with SNOMED. This evaluation will include stress-testing the libraries with our specific datasets to ensure they can handle the intricacies of phenotype data.

4. **SNOMED Integration and Visualization**: For the interactive visualization, we should design a prototype that allows clinicians to explore relationships between LLM outputs and SNOMED codes dynamically. This could be a graphical interface where clinicians can trace back each phenotype suggestion to its SNOMED concept, see related concepts, and understand the rationale behind each suggestion.

I'm looking forward to collaborating with the Data Visualization Expert to draft a concrete plan for this visualization approach.

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Data Visualization Expert

Thank you, Biomedical Informatics Specialist. Here are my thoughts and proposed actions for the current discussion:

1. **Clinician Feedback Integration**: I agree with the importance of integrating clinician feedback. To facilitate this, we can prototype interactive visualizations early and utilize user testing sessions with clinicians to gather feedback. These sessions will help us refine our visualizations to ensure they are intuitive and meet clinical needs. I propose we create a feedback loop using digital platforms where clinicians can provide insights and suggestions after interacting with the visualizations.

2. **Hybrid Approach**: The decision to use a hybrid approach is sound. From a visualization standpoint, we can develop visual components that highlight rule-based explanations alongside machine learning interpretations, allowing clinicians to choose the level of detail they want to explore.

3. **Use of Existing Libraries**: As we adapt existing libraries for visualization, I recommend focusing on creating custom visual modules that can clearly display the provenance of model outputs and their linkages to SNOMED concepts. These modules should be designed to overlay on top of the standard visualizations provided by libraries like SHAP or LIME.

4. **SNOMED Integration and Visualization**: To develop interactive visualizations, we could create a "concept map" interface. This would allow clinicians to see the LLM outputs mapped against SNOMED codes visually. We can use network diagrams to show connections between different concepts, making it easier to trace and understand the rationale of the model's suggestions. I suggest starting with a simple prototype and gradually adding complexity based on clinician feedback and testing.

I am ready to work closely with the Biomedical Informatics Specialist to flesh out these visualization strategies and develop an initial prototype for clinician testing. Let's hear what the Scientific Critic has to contribute next.

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you, Data Visualization Expert. Here are my critical reflections on the ongoing discussion:

1. **Clinician Feedback Integration**: The plan to involve clinicians is promising, but we must ensure that their feedback is systematically collected and translated into actionable improvements. A structured feedback framework with specific criteria for evaluation could be beneficial. We should also ensure that the feedback process is iterative and not just a one-time collection of opinions.

2. **Hybrid Approach**: While the hybrid approach is commendable, we should stay vigilant about the complexity it introduces. It's critical to maintain a balance between detailed interpretability and practical usability. We must guard against creating a system that is overly complicated for clinicians to navigate.

3. **Use of Existing Libraries**: Although adapting existing libraries is a pragmatic choice, we need a clear plan for validating these adaptations in a clinical setting. This validation should involve rigorous testing against diverse clinical scenarios to ensure our tool's reliability and robustness.

4. **SNOMED Integration and Visualization**: The proposed interactive visualizations sound effective, but it's crucial to ensure they do not overwhelm users with information. We should consider implementing tiered levels of detail, allowing clinicians to dig deeper into the data as needed without being inundated immediately.

In summary, while the plans are sound, the emphasis on thorough validation, clear documentation, and user-centric design will be critical to our success. I am keen to see how the Principal Investigator synthesizes these discussions into actionable plans for our next steps.

## User

This concludes round 2 of 3 of discussion. Principal Investigator, please synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Thank you, everyone, for your valuable insights. Let's consolidate the key points from our discussion and outline the next steps:

1. **Clinician Feedback Integration**: There is strong support for incorporating clinician feedback iteratively. We will establish a structured framework for gathering and implementing this feedback. This framework will involve workshops, focus groups, and digital platforms for continuous input. I'll collaborate with the Computational Linguist and Data Visualization Expert to draft a feedback protocol.

2. **Hybrid Approach**: The consensus supports a hybrid approach, balancing machine learning with rule-based systems. We must ensure this balance does not introduce unnecessary complexity. I'll work with the Scientific Critic to define the criteria for maintaining this balance and to regularly review the complexity versus usability.

3. **Use of Existing Libraries**: Adapting libraries like SHAP, LIME, Captum, and InterpretML is our chosen path. We need a plan for clinical validation of these adaptations, involving testing against diverse and realistic clinical scenarios. I'll coordinate with the Biomedical Informatics Specialist to outline this validation process.

4. **SNOMED Integration and Visualization**: The concept map interface and interactive visualizations are promising. However, we must ensure they are intuitive and not overwhelming. We will create tiered levels of detail to allow clinicians to explore outputs at their own pace. The Data Visualization Expert and Biomedical Informatics Specialist will lead the development of an initial prototype for clinician testing.

**Follow-up Questions and Next Steps:**
- **Computational Linguist and Data Visualization Expert**: Can you outline a draft feedback protocol for clinician interaction with our prototypes? What tools or platforms should we use for this feedback loop?
  
- **Biomedical Informatics Specialist**: Could you propose a detailed plan for validating the libraries we adapt, with a focus on clinical applicability?

- **Scientific Critic**: How can we effectively document and evaluate the balance between complexity and usability in our hybrid approach?

In the next round, let's focus on refining these plans and addressing any remaining uncertainties.

## User

Computational Linguist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 3 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Linguist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here's my input on the proposed follow-up actions:

1. **Feedback Protocol**: To develop a robust feedback protocol, I suggest we use a combination of online surveys and interactive workshops. Online surveys can capture initial reactions and quantitative data, while workshops can dive deeper into qualitative insights. These workshops could be structured around use case scenarios where clinicians interact with prototypes and discuss their experiences in real-time.

2. **Tools and Platforms**: For digital platforms, I recommend using tools like Qualtrics for surveys and Zoom or Microsoft Teams for workshops, as they allow for seamless interaction and data collection. We can also consider using collaboration platforms such as Miro or Google Jamboard during workshops to allow clinicians to visualize their thought processes and feedback.

3. **Iterative Process**: It's crucial that our feedback protocol is iterative, allowing for continuous improvement. After each feedback session, we should have a debrief to identify key takeaways and areas for improvement. Documenting these findings systematically will ensure that we can track progress and make informed adjustments.

I am eager to work with the Data Visualization Expert to flesh out these ideas further and develop a detailed plan for clinician engagement. I'll now pass it over to the Biomedical Informatics Specialist for their input.

## Biomedical Informatics Specialist

Thank you, Computational Linguist. Here are my thoughts on the next steps and validation process:

1. **Validation Plan for Libraries**: To ensure that the adapted libraries are clinically applicable, we need a detailed validation plan. I propose we start with a pilot study using real-world datasets that reflect the diversity of clinical scenarios we expect to encounter. This study should include a mix of retrospective data analysis and prospective testing to evaluate both the interpretability and accuracy of the libraries.

2. **Clinical Scenarios and Testing**: We should design test cases that cover a range of typical clinical scenarios, including common and rare conditions. This will help ensure that the adapted tools reliably identify and interpret phenotypes across different contexts. Engaging with clinicians to define these scenarios will be crucial for capturing the complexity of real-world applications.

3. **Metrics for Success**: Establishing clear metrics for success is critical. These could include accuracy, interpretability (as rated by clinicians), and the relevance of SNOMED mappings. We should also consider metrics related to the usability of the visualizations.

4. **Iterative Feedback and Refinement**: As we conduct validation studies, continuous feedback from our clinician partners will be essential. I recommend setting regular check-in points throughout the validation process to assess progress and make necessary adjustments.

I'm ready to collaborate with the Data Visualization Expert to integrate these validation elements into our overall project plan. Let's hear from the Data Visualization Expert next.

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 3 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you, Data Visualization Expert. As we conclude this discussion, here are my critical reflections and suggestions:

1. **Feedback and Iteration**: The planned feedback loop is comprehensive, but we must ensure that it is not only iterative but also adaptive. This means being prepared to pivot if initial approaches do not meet clinician expectations. We should establish a protocol for identifying when a significant rethink is necessary, rather than just minor tweaks.

2. **Validation Methodology**: The proposed validation strategy is solid, but we need to rigorously define our validation criteria. This should include establishing baseline performance metrics before adaptations, to clearly measure improvements. Furthermore, including a diverse set of clinical scenarios is vital to avoid overfitting the tool to specific cases.

3. **Visualization Complexity**: While dynamic and interactive visualizations are beneficial, there is a risk of overwhelming users. We must ensure these visualizations offer simplicity alongside the ability to drill down into details. Hierarchical or layered visualization techniques could be useful, allowing users to access information at different levels of complexity based on their needs.

4. **Risk Management**: We should develop a risk management plan, particularly concerning data privacy and security as we engage with real clinical data. Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations will be critical as we scale our testing and deployment.

In closing, while the project is on a promising path, it will be crucial to maintain a focus on simplicity and usability, grounded in rigorous testing and validation. I look forward to how the Principal Investigator synthesizes these points into our action plan moving forward.
