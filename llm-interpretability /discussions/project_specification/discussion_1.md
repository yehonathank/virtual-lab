Computational Linguist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Linguist

Thank you. As a Computational Linguist, my focus is on ensuring the linguistic integrity and interpretability of LLM outputs within electronic phenotype definitions. Here's my take on the agenda:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I strongly advocate for a machine learning approach, as it is crucial for handling the nuances of natural language and the complexities involved in phenotype descriptions. This approach would enable us to leverage existing advances in NLP and continuously improve our models.

2. **Use of Open Source Libraries**: I recommend building upon existing open-source interpretability libraries. This allows us to take advantage of the community's collective expertise and focus our efforts on customizing and extending functionalities. Specifically, libraries like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and Captum (from PyTorch) could be beneficial for our task.

3. **Library Selection**: LIME and SHAP are excellent for local interpretability, helping clinicians understand predictions by approximating models locally. Captum offers a variety of attribution methods that could be particularly useful in tracing output decisions to specific input features, aligning well with phenotype characteristics.

4. **Algorithm Design**: In case we decide to create algorithms from scratch, I propose focusing on developing hybrid models that combine symbolic reasoning with LLMs. This can be achieved by incorporating rule-based systems that align with clinical logic and chain of thought processes.

5. **Addressing Hallucinations and Reasoning**: Utilizing RAG methodologies could be particularly effective for reducing hallucinations by augmenting LLMs with real-time, contextually relevant information. Integrating the SNOMED database will allow us to ground outputs in authoritative clinical knowledge, thereby enhancing reasoning and validity.

I look forward to hearing the perspectives of other team members and finding the best path forward as a team.
