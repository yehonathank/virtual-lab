## Computational Linguist

Thank you for setting the stage, and I appreciate the opportunity to delve into this project. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I support taking a machine learning approach. Given the complexity of language models and the nuances of medical terminology, machine learning techniques, particularly those tailored to NLP tasks, can significantly enhance our ability to interpret and refine LLM outputs.

2. **Library Utilization or Custom Development**: I recommend leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Developing from scratch could be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, many open-source frameworks are well-vetted by the community and offer robust functionalities that we can build upon.

3. **Existing Libraries**: I suggest considering libraries such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for generating understandable explanations, and ELI5, which is another potent tool for demystifying model decisions. Additionally, using Captum, which is designed for PyTorch, could be particularly beneficial since it’s highly adaptable for deep learning models.

4. **Algorithm Design**: If we were to design algorithms from scratch, I would focus on creating algorithms that integrate semantic networks from SNOMED to ensure a structured and logic-driven interpretation of LLM outputs. This could involve developing new attention mechanisms that align more closely with clinical reasoning.

5. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations**: To eliminate hallucinations, I propose using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which allows the model to pull in relevant, factual data dynamically. Integrating the SNOMED Database directly into our pipeline can guide the model's reasoning process, ensuring that outputs are grounded in medical reality and fostering a valid chain of thought logic.

I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the other team members.
