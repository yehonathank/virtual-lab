Here are my thoughts on the agenda:\n\n1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I support taking a machine learning approach. Given the complexity of language models and the nuances of medical terminology, machine learning techniques, particularly those tailored to NLP tasks, can significantly enhance our ability to interpret and refine LLM outputs.\n\n2. **Library Utilization or Custom Development**: I recommend leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries. Developing from scratch could be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, many open-source frameworks are well-vetted by the community and offer robust functionalities that we can build upon.\n\n3. **Existing Libraries**: I suggest considering libraries such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for generating understandable explanations, and ELI5, which is another potent tool for demystifying model decisions.
