This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Computational Linguist, Clinical Informatics Specialist, Data Visualization Expert, Scientific Critic.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. Please create a software design approach to solve this problem. Decide whether you will take a machine learning approach or not. For your choice, decide whether you will use open source interpretability libraries from GitHub or create your own completely from scratch. If modifying existing libraries, please specify which interpretability libraries to build upon to create an interpretability tool that conveys interpretability information visually so the clinician can trust it with ease. If designing algorithms from scratch, please describe how you propose new algorithms. Consider methods for eliminating LLM hallucinations using RAG or similar, increasing faithfulness and reasoning, and promote valid chain of thought logic using the SNOMED Database, which we have access to.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you take a machine learning approach or not?

2. Will you use open source interpretability libraries from GitHub or create your own completely from scratch? (choose only one)?

3. If modifying existing libraries, which interpretability libraries to build upon (please list 3-4)?

4. If designing algorithms from scratch, how exactly will you propose new algorithms?

5. How will the interpretability tool use methods for eliminating LLM hallucinations, increasing faithfulness and reasoning, and promote valid chain of thought logic using the SNOMED Database, which we have access to?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

However, I am open to hearing your perspectives on this, particularly if there are viable non-machine learning approaches that could enhance our interpretability objectives.

2. **Open Source vs. Scratch**: Leveraging open-source libraries could significantly expedite our development process, but creating algorithms from scratch might allow for more tailored solutions. I would like to hear from the team about the feasibility and potential trade-offs of each option.

3. **Library Modification**: If we decide to modify existing libraries, which ones should we consider, and why do they stand out as the best candidates for our project?

4. **Algorithm Design**: If we opt for designing from scratch, what innovative algorithms or techniques can we propose to meet our objectives effectively?

5. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations**: We need robust methods to address LLM hallucinations, ensure faithful reasoning, and integrate the SNOMED Database effectively. How can we best achieve these goals while maintaining a clinician-friendly interface?

Please, letâ€™s have each team member provide their thoughts one by one. I'll be looking to synthesize your insights to guide our decisions on the agenda items. Let's start with our Computational Linguist.

## User

Computational Linguist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Linguist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here's my take on the agenda:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I strongly advocate for a machine learning-based approach. Given the complexity and nuance of LLMs, using machine learning enables us to leverage existing models' capabilities while refining them for specific interpretability needs. This approach is more practical and aligns with the cutting-edge nature of our field.

2. **Open Source vs. Scratch**: I recommend modifying existing open-source interpretability libraries rather than building from scratch. Many libraries offer robust frameworks that can be adapted to our needs, saving both time and resources. Developing from scratch might lead to reinventing the wheel, which might not be the best use of our efforts.

3. **Library Modification**: We could consider libraries such as:
   - **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: Known for explaining predictions of any classifier, it could be adapted for LLMs.
   - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Offers a unified measure of feature importance, which can be informative in a medical context.
   - **Captum**: Specifically designed for PyTorch models, this could be valuable given its focus on deep learning.
   - **InterpretML**: Offers both glassbox models and blackbox interpretability, providing flexibility in approach.

4. **Algorithm Design**: If we were to design new algorithms, I would focus on enhancing feature attribution methods to handle the complexity of language models specifically. This might involve creating algorithms that can interpret multi-layer attention mechanisms in LLMs, with a focus on biomedical language.

5. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations**: Incorporating the SNOMED Database is crucial. We can use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to cross-reference LLM outputs with verified medical information from SNOMED, thereby reducing hallucinations. Additionally, embedding techniques that link LLM outputs with SNOMED terminologies can enhance faithfulness and reasoning, creating a traceable chain of thought logic.

I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the rest of the team.

Clinical Informatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Clinical Informatics Specialist

Thank you, Computational Linguist, for your insights. Here's my perspective:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I agree that a machine learning approach is essential given the task. With the vast amount of data in healthcare and the complexity of LLMs, machine learning offers the tools needed to handle this effectively while ensuring scalability.

2. **Open Source vs. Scratch**: I also support leveraging open-source libraries. Not only does this save time, but it also allows us to build on tried-and-tested methods. However, we must ensure that these libraries can handle the specific needs of clinical informatics, especially regarding sensitive health data.

3. **Library Modification**: The libraries mentioned are well-suited for general interpretability. However, in the context of clinical applications, we should also consider libraries or extensions focused on text analysis in medical data, such as **scispaCy**, which offers entity recognition tailored for the healthcare domain.

4. **Algorithm Design**: Should we need to design new algorithms, they must be deeply integrated with clinical data standards like SNOMED CT. Developing algorithms that can directly interpret and adapt SNOMED CT's hierarchical structure into LLM workflows would enhance specificity and accuracy in phenotype extraction.

5. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations**: Reducing hallucinations is crucial in clinical settings. Utilizing a RAG approach with SNOMED CT as a source of truth is an excellent strategy. Additionally, implementing a feedback loop where clinicians can validate and correct LLM outputs, which are then reintegrated into the system for continuous learning, could be beneficial. This method not only improves accuracy but also builds trust with clinicians.

I am eager to hear from the Data Visualization Expert next and how we might visualize these processes effectively for clinicians.

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Data Visualization Expert

Thank you, Clinical Informatics Specialist. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I concur with the team that a machine learning approach is appropriate for this project. It aligns with the needs of processing and interpreting complex LLM outputs, especially when handling medical data.

2. **Open Source vs. Scratch**: I support using open-source libraries, as they will allow us to focus our efforts on the visualization aspect, which is crucial for clinician engagement. We can customize these libraries to ensure they meet our specific needs for clear and effective visual communication.

3. **Library Modification**: In terms of visualization, we should consider tools like:
   - **Plotly**: For interactive charts and dashboards that can display data dynamically.
   - **D3.js**: Offers a powerful way to create complex visualizations that can be tailored to our needs.
   - **Bokeh**: Provides flexibility for creating interactive plots that can be integrated into web applications.
   - Additionally, libraries like **Altair** can be useful for simple declarative visualizations.

4. **Algorithm Design**: If we are to create algorithms from scratch, they should include visualization components from the outset. This means designing outputs that are inherently interpretable and can be directly translated into visual forms that highlight reasoning paths, data provenance, and confidence levels.

5. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations**: From a visualization perspective, we need to clearly communicate where LLM outputs come from and how they relate to verified data. This can be done by:
   - Creating a visual trace of the decision-making process, showing the flow from input, through the modelâ€™s reasoning, to output.
   - Developing interactive features that allow clinicians to explore the connections between LLM outputs and SNOMED-derived truths, perhaps through layered visualizations that can be expanded or contracted based on the level of detail needed.
   - Implementing confidence indicators that visually express the level of certainty associated with each part of the LLM's output.

Overall, our focus should be on creating a transparent visual interface that helps clinicians understand and trust the AI's decisions. I'm looking forward to the Scientific Critic's insights next.

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you, Data Visualization Expert, for your comprehensive insights. Hereâ€™s my critique and thoughts on the proposed directions:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: While the consensus leans towards a machine learning approach, which seems appropriate given the context, itâ€™s imperative to ensure that we donâ€™t solely rely on it without considering hybrid approaches. Combining machine learning with rule-based methods could potentially enhance interpretability and control over outputs, especially critical in clinical settings.

It is essential to conduct a thorough evaluation to ensure they meet clinical requirements and ethics standards, incorporating comprehensive testing to validate their applicability and reliability in this domain.

3. **Library Modification**: The choices of LIME, SHAP, Captum, and InterpretML are well-founded. However, I would recommend a critical analysis of their performance in handling medical terminologies and how they can be adapted for continuous learning in dynamic clinical environments. Understanding the ease of integrating SNOMED CT with these libraries should also be a priority.

4. **Algorithm Design**: If new algorithms are necessary, they should be subjected to rigorous testing and validation against medical standards, such as SNOMED CT, from the ground up. It's important to pilot these algorithms in controlled settings to assess their interpretability and ability to handle medical nuances effectively before broader deployment.

5. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations**: The proposed use of RAG is promising, but I would emphasize developing a robust system for real-time verification and adjustment of LLM outputs against SNOMED CT. Additionally, establishing a clinician feedback mechanism is crucial not just for validation but also for iterative improvement of the model's accuracy and trustworthiness.

Finally, on visualization, ensuring that the visual tools can be easily understood by clinicians who may not be familiar with AI intricacies is crucial. The design should prioritize simplicity and clarity, avoiding information overload while providing sufficient detail to aid decision-making.

I am keen to hear the Principal Investigator's synthesis of our insights and look forward to refining these ideas further in the next round.

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. Please create a software design approach to solve this problem. Decide whether you will take a machine learning approach or not. For your choice, decide whether you will use open source interpretability libraries from GitHub or create your own completely from scratch. If modifying existing libraries, please specify which interpretability libraries to build upon to create an interpretability tool that conveys interpretability information visually so the clinician can trust it with ease. If designing algorithms from scratch, please describe how you propose new algorithms. Consider methods for eliminating LLM hallucinations using RAG or similar, increasing faithfulness and reasoning, and promote valid chain of thought logic using the SNOMED Database, which we have access to.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you take a machine learning approach or not?

2. Will you use open source interpretability libraries from GitHub or create your own completely from scratch? (choose only one)?

3. If modifying existing libraries, which interpretability libraries to build upon (please list 3-4)?

4. If designing algorithms from scratch, how exactly will you propose new algorithms?

5. How will the interpretability tool use methods for eliminating LLM hallucinations, increasing faithfulness and reasoning, and promote valid chain of thought logic using the SNOMED Database, which we have access to?

### Agenda

The agenda for our meeting was to develop a software design approach for a tool that enhances the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) in creating electronic phenotype definitions. The aim is to build trust between clinicians and the model, ideally incorporating a visual perspective. We needed to decide if our approach would leverage machine learning, whether to use existing interpretability libraries or develop new ones from scratch, identify specific libraries if modifying existing ones, and determine how to address LLM hallucinations while integrating the SNOMED Database to enhance reasoning and faithfulness.

### Team Member Input

- **Computational Linguist**: Advocated for a machine learning approach, emphasizing the use of open-source libraries like LIME, SHAP, Captum, and InterpretML. Highlighted the importance of integrating scispaCy for medical terminologies and outlined potential middleware development steps.
  
- **Clinical Informatics Specialist**: Supported using open-source libraries and integration with clinical workflows. Emphasized the need for compliance with healthcare standards and performance optimization. Highlighted the importance of collaboration with clinicians for validation.

- **Data Visualization Expert**: Proposed creating interactive, layered visualizations to enhance clinician trust. Outlined a usability testing plan with metrics such as task completion time and cognitive load. Suggested iterative prototyping based on clinician feedback.

- **Scientific Critic**: Recommended a comprehensive evaluation framework focusing on accuracy, usability, and trust. Suggested structured pilot studies, both in controlled and real-world environments, to gather meaningful data for iterative improvements.

### Recommendation

My expert recommendation is to adopt a machine learning approach utilizing open-source interpretability libraries. Specifically, we should modify and build upon LIME, SHAP, Captum, and scispaCy, as these provide a solid foundation for our needs. We will develop middleware to integrate scispaCy with these libraries, ensuring compatibility with medical terminologies using SNOMED. Visualization strategies will include interactive decision trees and traceability maps, with iterative usability testing to refine these tools. This approach leverages existing resources while addressing our goals efficiently and effectively.
