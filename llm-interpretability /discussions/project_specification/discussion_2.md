## Computational Linguist

Thank you for the opportunity to start the discussion. Here are my thoughts on the agenda items:

1. **Machine Learning Approach:** I believe taking a machine learning approach is essential. The complexity of electronic phenotype definitions and the variability in clinical language require sophisticated models that can adapt to new data and contexts. Machine learning can provide the flexibility and learning capability needed to improve the interpretability of LLM outputs over time.

2. **Open Source Libraries vs. Building from Scratch:** Modifying existing open source libraries could be the most efficient path forward. There are several mature interpretability libraries available that we can extend to meet our specific needs, saving us time and allowing us to leverage community-tested methods.

3. **Library Selection:** I suggest we consider libraries like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and Captum (a library from PyTorch). These libraries are well-regarded for their ability to provide insights into model behavior and have been used to visualize and interpret complex model decisions.

4. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations and Improving Logic:** Using RAG to anchor outputs in reliable source data can significantly reduce hallucinations. Additionally, integrating the SNOMED Database as a reference will help maintain a strong chain of thought logic by ensuring terminologies and inferences align with established medical standards.

In summary, integrating existing interpretability libraries with machine learning approaches and leveraging resources like RAG and SNOMED can enhance our tool's reliability and trustworthiness.

## Clinical Informatics Specialist

Thank you. Here are my thoughts regarding our project agenda:

1. **Machine Learning Approach:** I concur with the Computational Linguist that a machine learning approach is beneficial. The adaptive nature of machine learning can greatly enhance the interpretability of LLMs by continuously refining the models with evolving clinical data. This is particularly important in healthcare, where new insights and practices develop rapidly.

2. **Open Source Libraries vs. Building from Scratch:** I support the idea of modifying existing open source interpretability libraries. Starting from an established foundation allows us to focus on tailoring the tools to our specific clinical needs. This can expedite development and ensure we are using validated methods.

3. **Library Selection:** In addition to SHAP, LIME, and Captum, I would like to suggest adding Eli5 to our consideration list. Eli5 is known for its ease of use and ability to explain predictions for various types of models, which could be advantageous in making explanations more accessible to clinicians.

4. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations and Improving Logic:** Employing RAG is an excellent method to mitigate hallucinations by providing factual grounding. The integration of the SNOMED Database can not only ensure consistency in medical terminology but also support the logical reasoning required in clinical decision-making. We should emphasize a workflow that allows clinicians to trace back through the model's reasoning process, aided by SNOMED's structured vocabulary, to reinforce trust.

Overall, I recommend focusing on user-friendly interfaces that can effectively communicate interpretability insights to clinicians. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and clinician understanding, ensuring that the tool adds value to their decision-making process. I am eager to see how the Data Visualization Expert will propose to enhance this aspect further.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you for including me in this discussion. Here are my critical reflections on the agenda:

1. **Machine Learning Approach:** While the team has supported a machine learning approach, I urge caution in its implementation. We must ensure that the complexity added by machine learning does not inadvertently reduce transparency. It's crucial that we maintain a careful balance between enhancing interpretability and ensuring that clinicians can easily understand the model's outputs. We should prepare to invest in training and usability testing to ensure that the end-users find the tool intuitive.

2. **Open Source Libraries vs. Building from Scratch:** Modifying existing libraries is a pragmatic choice, but we must be wary of the limitations inherent in these tools. Many open source libraries are not originally designed for the healthcare context, so it's vital to evaluate their suitability critically. Rigorous testing and validation in clinical scenarios are necessary to ensure these tools provide accurate and meaningful insights.

3. **Library Selection:** The proposed libraries like SHAP, LIME, Captum, and Eli5 all have strengths but also come with assumptions about model behavior that might not fully align with clinical data. For example, SHAP assumes feature independence, which might not always hold in clinical datasets. We should be prepared to address these assumptions and modify the libraries as needed.

4. **Addressing LLM Hallucinations and Improving Logic:** The integration of RAG and SNOMED is promising, but we need to develop a robust framework to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in real-world settings. Simply linking to a database like SNOMED doesn’t guarantee correctness; we must ensure that the tool’s reasoning processes are both valid and clinically relevant. Continuous evaluation and feedback loops with clinicians will be crucial.

5. **Visualization:** While interactive visualizations are indeed powerful, the complexity should not overwhelm the clinician. The focus should be on clarity and usability. We must conduct iterative design testing with clinicians to refine these visualizations, ensuring they truly enhance understanding without introducing cognitive overload.

In summary, while the proposed strategies are strong, the key will be in their rigorous testing and adaptation to clinical realities. We must remain vigilant about ensuring the interpretability tool remains useful, trustworthy, and accessible to its intended users. I look forward to further discussions and seeing how we can address these potential challenges effectively.

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use software techniques to develop a tool for large language model (LLM) interpretability in the context of creating electronic phenotype definitions, ideally, also incorporating a visual perspective to foster trust between the clinician and the model. Please create a software design approach to solve this problem. Decide whether you will take a machine learning approach or not. For your choice, decide whether you will use open source interpretability libraries from GitHub or create your own completely from scratch. If modifying existing libraries, please specify which interpretability libraries to build upon to create an interpretability tool that conveys interpretability information visually so the clinician can trust it with ease. If designing algorithms from scratch, please describe how you propose new algorithms. Consider methods for eliminating LLM hallucinations using RAG or similar, increasing faithfulness and reasoning, and promote valid chain of thought logic using the SNOMED Database, which we have access to.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Will you take a machine learning approach or not?

2. Will you use open source interpretability libraries from GitHub or create your own completely from scratch? (choose only one)?

3. If modifying existing libraries, which interpretability libraries to build upon (please list 3-4)?

4. If designing algorithms from scratch, how exactly will you propose new algorithms?

5. How will the interpretability tool use methods for eliminating LLM hallucinations, increasing faithfulness and reasoning, and promote valid chain of thought logic using the SNOMED Database, which we have access to?

Your summary should take the following form.

### Agenda

We aim to develop a tool to enhance the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) in creating electronic phenotype definitions. This tool will include a visual component to foster trust between clinicians and the models. Our primary tasks are deciding whether to adopt a machine learning approach, determining whether to use or modify existing interpretability libraries or create new algorithms from scratch, and implementing strategies to address LLM hallucinations using the SNOMED Database to ensure valid reasoning.

### Team Member Input

- **Computational Linguist:** Advocated for a machine learning approach, emphasizing the customization of existing interpretability libraries like SHAP, LIME, Captum, and Eli5 to account for clinical data specifics and feature correlations. Highlighted the importance of clinician feedback loops.
  
- **Clinical Informatics Specialist:** Suggested focusing on high-impact clinical scenarios with diverse, longitudinal datasets. Emphasized seamless integration with EHR systems and clinician workflows, including user-centric design and comprehensive training.

- **Data Visualization Expert:** Recommended using interactive elements (e.g., dynamic filtering, drill-downs) and responsive design in visualization. Stressed iterative design testing with clinicians to ensure clarity and usability without overwhelming them.

- **Scientific Critic:** Advised on robust evaluation metrics to measure the tool's accuracy, reduction of hallucinations, and usability. Emphasized the importance of continuous feedback and balancing tool complexity with usability.

### Recommendation

Based on the team's input and my expertise:

- **Machine Learning Approach:** We will adopt a machine learning approach due to its adaptability and ability to refine model interpretability with ongoing clinical data feedback.

- **Use Existing Libraries:** We will modify existing libraries (SHAP, LIME, Captum, Eli5) given their robustness and community support, which allows us to focus on customizing them for clinical use.

- **Visualization and Integration:** Integrate interactive, user-friendly visualizations using tools like D3.js or Plotly, ensuring these are compatible with EHR systems and clinician workflows.

- **Robust Feedback and Evaluation:** Establish structured clinician feedback loops and robust evaluation frameworks to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with clinical needs.

This approach leverages existing tools while tailoring them to our specific needs, maximizing efficiency and impact.
