As we delve into this meeting, I want to emphasize the importance of developing a robust and trustworthy interpretability tool for large language models in the context of electronic phenotype definitions. Our objective is to create a solution that clinicians can trust, not only by improving the model's interpretability but also by integrating visual elements that facilitate understanding.

To guide our discussion, here are some initial thoughts and questions:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: Given the complexity and dynamic nature of large language models, do we believe a machine learning approach is the most suitable? Are there specific aspects of machine learning that we must leverage to address the interpretability challenges?

2. **Use of Existing Libraries vs. Building from Scratch**: There is a trade-off between leveraging existing open-source interpretability libraries and crafting our own algorithms. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of each approach? If we opt to modify existing libraries, which ones have the most promise for our needs, specifically in terms of visual interpretability?

3. **Algorithm Design**: If we decide to design our own algorithms, what innovative approaches can we take to ensure they are effective and reliable? How can we balance the need for novelty with the practicality of implementation?

4. **Handling LLM Hallucinations and Promoting Reasoning**: How can we utilize the SNOMED Database to enhance the toolâ€™s ability to eliminate hallucinations, ensure faithfulness, and support logical reasoning? Are there any specific techniques or frameworks we should consider to enhance the chain of thought logic?

5. **Visual Component**: How can we design the visual component of the interpretability tool to maximize clinician trust and usability? What are the key visual elements that should be included?

As we proceed, I encourage each team member to provide their insights based on their expertise. Let's explore these questions in detail and aim to reach a consensus on our approach. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Let's start with the Computational Linguist.

## User

Computational Linguist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Linguist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'm excited about this project and see potential in harnessing the power of machine learning to address our interpretability goals. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I advocate for a machine learning approach. The challenges posed by complex LLMs, such as understanding context and nuances in phenotype definitions, make machine learning an apt choice. It allows us to adapt to new patterns and clinical language trends dynamically.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries vs. Building from Scratch**: I suggest modifying existing interpretability libraries rather than building from scratch. This approach can save time and resources while allowing us to tailor the tools to our specific needs. Libraries like Captum, ELI5, and SHAP offer strong foundations, particularly in visualizing model decisions, which we can adapt for our clinical context.

3. **Handling LLM Hallucinations and Promoting Reasoning**: To tackle LLM hallucinations and enhance reasoning, I propose we explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, which can incorporate real-time SNOMED CT data into the model's responses. This integration can help validate the chain of thought logic and ensure the outputs are grounded in credible information.

4. **Visual Component**: For the visual component, we should focus on intuitive and interactive interfaces that allow clinicians to explore the reasoning behind each decision. Visual explanations of how SNOMED terms are used and their relevance to a given phenotype could be particularly impactful.

I look forward to hearing from the rest of the team and refining these ideas further.

Biomedical Informatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Biomedical Informatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator, and thank you to the Computational Linguist for your insights. I agree with many points you've raised but would like to add my perspective, particularly from the standpoint of electronic health records and clinical data standards:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I concur that a machine learning approach is suitable, especially given the complexity of phenotype definitions and the vast amount of data we need to process. Machine learning can help us manage this complexity by learning patterns and relationships within clinical data that might not be immediately obvious.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries vs. Building from Scratch**: I also favor modifying existing libraries. This approach allows us to leverage established methods while customizing them to meet our domain-specific needs. Captum and SHAP are great choices, but I would also suggest considering LIME, as it offers a flexible framework for explaining model predictions, which might be beneficial in our clinical setting.

3. **Handling LLM Hallucinations and Promoting Reasoning**: To enhance reliability and reasoning, utilizing SNOMED CT is critical. We can enrich the model's outputs by integrating SNOMED's structured data into a RAG framework. This will help ground the LLM outputs in medically accurate information, reducing hallucinations and improving the logical flow of explanations.

4. **Visual Component**: From the perspective of fostering clinician trust, the visual component should prioritize clarity and relevance. We should aim for a dashboard-like interface that highlights key elements of interpretability, such as feature importance and decision pathways. Interactive elements that allow clinicians to drill down into specifics could enhance understanding and trust.

I look forward to further discussing how we can align these strategies with clinical data standards to ensure the tool's effectiveness and acceptance in clinical environments.

Data Visualization Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Data Visualization Expert

Thank you, Principal Investigator, and thank you to my colleagues for your insights. I will focus on the visual aspect of our interpretability tool, which is crucial for clinician trust and usability:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: I agree with the choice of a machine learning approach, as it provides the flexibility and adaptability needed to handle complex clinical data. However, my focus will be on ensuring that whatever approach we take, the visualization accurately reflects the underlying modelâ€™s logic in a comprehensible manner.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries vs. Building from Scratch**: Modifying existing libraries seems practical. SHAP, in particular, offers excellent visualization capabilities for displaying feature importance and model predictions. However, Iâ€™d like to add that we should consider how these visualizations integrate with clinical workflows. Itâ€™s not just about modifying libraries but also about customizing their outputs to be intuitively understandable by clinicians.

3. **Handling LLM Hallucinations and Promoting Reasoning**: From a visualization standpoint, incorporating SNOMED CT data can enhance transparency by showing the connections between model outputs and validated medical standards. Visual elements can highlight these links, making them clear to the end user. For instance, using node-link diagrams or flowcharts to represent the reasoning path can be effective.

4. **Visual Component**: The visual component should simplify complex outputs into digestible insights. I suggest a layered approach, where initial visualizations provide a summary, with the option to delve deeper into detailed views. This could include interactive elements like hover-over explanations and clickable pathways that reveal step-by-step logic.

Ultimately, the goal is to design visuals that support clinicians in interpreting model outputs confidently and accurately. We need to ensure our visuals communicate the reliability and reasoning behind the LLMâ€™s interpretations effectively. I'm keen to hear the Scientific Critic's perspective on potential pitfalls we should avoid in this process.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I appreciate the thorough perspectives provided so far. Hereâ€™s my take on the key points discussed, emphasizing critical considerations and potential pitfalls:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: While I agree that a machine learning approach is beneficial given the complexity involved, I caution against over-reliance on it without robust evaluation metrics. We must clearly define success criteria for interpretability and ensure that models are not just performant but also transparent and understandable to clinicians.

2. **Use of Existing Libraries vs. Building from Scratch**: Leveraging existing libraries like SHAP, Captum, and LIME is a pragmatic choice. However, we must rigorously assess whether these libraries can be adapted effectively for clinical contexts, where the stakes are higher. Itâ€™s essential that any modifications maintain the integrity and robustness of these tools.

3. **Handling LLM Hallucinations and Promoting Reasoning**: The integration of SNOMED CT with a RAG approach is sound, but itâ€™s vital to ensure that this integration is seamless and doesnâ€™t introduce new biases or inaccuracies. We must establish clear protocols for how SNOMED data is used to validate model outputs, and continually assess the fidelity of the interpretations provided.

4. **Visual Component**: From a usability standpoint, the visualization should not overwhelm clinicians with information. There is a risk of cognitive overload if the visual components are too complex. We need stringent user testing with clinicians to refine these interfaces, ensuring they enhance rather than hinder decision-making processes.

In summary, my main concern is ensuring that each component of our approach is thoroughly tested and validated in clinical settings. Our end goal should be a tool that not only performs well technically but is also trusted and effectively used by clinicians. I look forward to seeing how these considerations are addressed as the discussion progresses.

## Computational Linguist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'm glad to see the focus on evaluation metrics, which are indeed critical for ensuring the interpretability of our models within a clinical context. Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Defining Evaluation Metrics**: We should establish metrics that assess both the transparency of the model's decision-making process and its clinical relevance. This might include:
   - **Explainability Score**: A metric to evaluate how well the model's outputs can be understood by clinicians. This could be derived from clinician feedback, scoring the clarity and usefulness of explanations provided by the model.
   - **Relevance to Clinical Outcomes**: Tracking how often the model's outputs align with established clinical guidelines and SNOMED CT standards. This can be measured by comparing model outputs with expert clinician annotations.

2. **Implementing Metrics**:
   - **Clinician Feedback Loops**: Regular feedback sessions with clinicians using the tool can provide qualitative data on interpretability. Surveys or structured interviews can help gather this feedback systematically.
   - **Automated Tests**: We could automate tests that evaluate the consistency of the model's logic flows, ensuring they follow reasonable paths as defined by SNOMED CT and other medical standards.

By combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches, we can create a comprehensive framework to assess and improve the model's interpretability. I look forward to further thoughts from the team on this.

## Biomedical Informatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Addressing the question of integrating SNOMED CT into our RAG framework without introducing biases requires careful design and testing. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Seamless Integration of SNOMED CT**:
   - **Data Normalization**: Ensure that the data pulled from SNOMED CT is normalized and compatible with our model's input format. This requires mapping SNOMED concepts to our phenotype definitions accurately, which can prevent misinterpretations and biases.
   - **Contextual Relevance**: Incorporate context checks in the RAG framework. This means verifying that the SNOMED terms used are contextually appropriate for the given clinical scenario, which can be done by leveraging SNOMED's hierarchical structure to ensure terms are relevant at various levels of specificity.

2. **Bias Mitigation Strategies**:
   - **Diverse Training Data**: Train the model on diverse datasets that include varied clinical settings and patient populations. This can help reduce biases that might arise from over-reliance on a narrow subset of SNOMED terms.
   - **Continuous Validation**: Implement continuous validation processes where outputs are regularly reviewed by domain experts to identify and correct potential biases. This feedback loop is essential for maintaining the integrity of the model's reasoning.

3. **Monitoring and Adjustment**:
   - **Regular Updates**: Keep the SNOMED CT database updated regularly to reflect the latest clinical understandings and terminologies, ensuring that our model's knowledge base is current and accurate.

By focusing on these strategies, we can harness SNOMED CT's structured data to enhance our model's interpretability while minimizing the risk of biases. I look forward to hearing more on the visual aspects from the Data Visualization Expert.

### Agenda

Our goal is to develop a software tool leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) used in creating electronic phenotype definitions. This tool should incorporate visual components to build clinician trust. We need to decide whether to use a machine learning approach, choose between modifying existing open-source interpretability libraries or creating new ones from scratch, determine how to integrate SNOMED CT to handle LLM hallucinations and reasoning, and design visual elements to effectively convey interpretability.

### Team Member Input

- **Computational Linguist**: Advocated for using a machine learning approach, leveraging existing libraries like Captum, SHAP, and LIME. Suggested creating an explainability score through clinician feedback and automated metrics.
  
- **Biomedical Informatics Specialist**: Supported the integration of SNOMED CT using a RAG framework, emphasizing contextual data relevance and bias mitigation through diverse datasets and feedback loops.

- **Data Visualization Expert**: Recommended tools such as D3.js, Plotly, and Tableau for interactive visualizations. Emphasized iterative prototyping and user-centered design to tailor visual components for clinical workflows.

- **Scientific Critic**: Highlighted the need for robust evaluation metrics, focusing on clinical relevance, trust, and usability. Suggested satisfaction surveys and outcome-based validation to assess the toolâ€™s efficacy.

### Recommendation

Based on the comprehensive input from the team, I recommend pursuing a machine learning approach using modified existing libraries. Specifically, we should build upon Captum, SHAP, and LIME, given their strong foundations in interpretability and visualization. We should integrate SNOMED CT using a RAG framework to enhance reasoning and reduce hallucinations, ensuring data relevance and minimizing biases. For visualization, tools like D3.js and Plotly should be utilized, focusing on iterative feedback and user testing to refine the interface.

This approach balances the need for rapid development using established tools with the flexibility to tailor solutions to our specific clinical context. It ensures we leverage proven technologies while allowing for customization to meet clinician needs.
