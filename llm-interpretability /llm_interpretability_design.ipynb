       "\n",
       "The objective of this meeting was to design a software approach for creating a tool that enhances the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) in defining electronic phenotypes. The tool should incorporate a visual component to build clinician trust. We needed to decide whether to use a machine learning approach, choose between open-source libraries or building from scratch, identify specific libraries if applicable, consider how to develop new algorithms if needed, and integrate methods to reduce LLM hallucinations using SNOMED and RAG.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Team Member Input\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Computational Linguist**: Advocated for a machine learning approach and suggested using existing interpretability libraries such as LIME, SHAP, and Captum. Emphasized the importance of using RAG and SNOMED for logical consistency. Highlighted the need for structured data processing and clinician involvement through platforms like Miro.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Clinical Informatics Specialist**: Supported machine learning and the use of existing libraries, recommending additional criteria like interoperability and scalability.

Supported using existing libraries and stressed the importance of clinician-centric design through interactive prototyping.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Scientific Critic**: Agreed on using existing libraries but cautioned about maintaining focus and avoiding scope drift. Recommended structured evaluation processes and thorough documentation for SNOMED and RAG integration. Highlighted the need for clear protocols for clinician feedback incorporation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendation\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the discussions, I recommend adopting a machine learning approach and utilizing existing open-source interpretability libraries. Specifically, we should build upon LIME, SHAP, Captum, and ELI5 for their robust capabilities and community support. This decision leverages tested tools, which can be customized to meet our unique needs. Additionally, integrating SNOMED and RAG will facilitate logical consistency and reduce hallucinations.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Justification**: Machine learning provides the flexibility and adaptability required for interpreting complex biomedical data. Existing libraries offer a solid foundation and can be adapted to our specific needs without the resource burden of building from scratch. Visual components using tools like Plotly or Tableau will enhance trust and usability for clinicians.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Answers\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Will you take a machine learning approach or not?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: Yes, we will take a machine learning approach.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: Machine learning can effectively handle the complexity and volume of biomedical data, allowing for dynamic interpretation and adaptability.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Will you use open source interpretability libraries from GitHub or create your own completely from scratch?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: Use open-source interpretability libraries.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: Existing libraries like LIME, SHAP, Captum, and ELI5 provide proven methodologies and community support, making them a practical choice for adaptation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **If modifying existing libraries, which interpretability libraries to build upon?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: LIME, SHAP, Captum, ELI5.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: These libraries are well-regarded for their interpretability features and have been successfully used in various applications, including clinical contexts.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **If designing algorithms from scratch, how exactly will you propose new algorithms?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: Not applicable, as we are using existing libraries.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: The decision to use existing libraries negates the immediate need for developing new algorithms from scratch.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **How will the interpretability tool use methods for eliminating LLM hallucinations, increasing faithfulness and reasoning, and promoting valid chain of thought logic using the SNOMED Database?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: Integrate SNOMED and RAG into the tool.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: SNOMED provides a structured framework for medical terminologies, ensuring logical consistency, while RAG helps ground model outputs in real-world data, reducing hallucinations.\n",

This would involve using SNOMED CT's official APIs to map terms and enhance reasoning capabilities.\n",

       "3. **Few-shot Learning Strategy**: While the script currently uses data splitting as a preliminary strategy, I have noted the need for distinct few-shot learning techniques, such as using meta-learning or fine-tuning with small datasets, which should be explored in future iterations.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Data Preprocessing and SNOMED CT Integration**: This component is inspired by summaries 1 and 5, which emphasize the importance of preprocessing and integrating SNOMED CT for enhancing reasoning. The script includes a placeholder for SNOMED CT integration, which can be expanded with real API calls.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Few-shot Learning Strategy**: Summaries 2 and 4 highlight the need for few-shot learning. The script includes an option to load additional datasets for few-shot learning, allowing the model to adapt to rare conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Interpretability with LIME**: Summaries 3 and 5 focus on using LIME for interpretability. The script integrates LIME to provide explanations for model predictions, helping clinicians understand which tokens influenced the model's decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Output Format and Documentation**: Summary 4 emphasizes the importance of a structured output format and comprehensive documentation. The script outputs results in a JSON format, including both extracted entities and LIME explanations, and includes detailed docstrings and comments for clarity.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Reproducibility and Logging**: Summaries 4 and 5 stress the importance of reproducibility and logging. The script sets a random seed for reproducibility and uses logging to track the process, ensuring transparency and ease of debugging.\n",
       "\n",
       "By combining these components, the solution effectively addresses the agenda, providing a robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant tool for phenotype extraction using BioBERT/ClinicalBERT.\n",

    "{background_prompt} {project_specific_prompt} Now you must use BioBERT or ClinicalBERT to extract phenotype-relevant information from clinical notes. Your task is to write a complete Python script that loads a pretrained BioBERT/ClinicalBERT model, fine-tunes it on a phenotyping dataset (e.g., OHDSI or PheKB), and identifies relevant features (diagnoses, labs, symptoms) for a given phenotype definition. The script should include:\n",
    "1. Code to load and preprocess a sample clinical text dataset.\n",
    "2. Fine-tuning code using HuggingFace Transformers.\n",
    "3. Inference code that extracts phenotype-defining tokens from raw clinical notes.\n",
