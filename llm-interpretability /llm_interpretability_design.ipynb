       "### Agenda\n",
       "\n",
       "The objective of this meeting was to design a software approach for creating a tool that enhances the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) in defining electronic phenotypes. The tool should incorporate a visual component to build clinician trust. We needed to decide whether to use a machine learning approach, choose between open-source libraries or building from scratch, identify specific libraries if applicable, consider how to develop new algorithms if needed, and integrate methods to reduce LLM hallucinations using SNOMED and RAG.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Team Member Input\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Computational Linguist**: Advocated for a machine learning approach and suggested using existing interpretability libraries such as LIME, SHAP, and Captum. Emphasized the importance of using RAG and SNOMED for logical consistency. Highlighted the need for structured data processing and clinician involvement through platforms like Miro.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Clinical Informatics Specialist**: Supported machine learning and the use of existing libraries, recommending additional criteria like interoperability and scalability. Suggested co-design with clinicians via platforms like Miro and regular feedback loops. Recommended tools like Tableau for ease of use in visualization.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Data Visualization Expert**: Emphasized the importance of visual components, recommending Plotly or Tableau for visualization due to their balance of complexity and usability. Supported using existing libraries and stressed the importance of clinician-centric design through interactive prototyping.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Scientific Critic**: Agreed on using existing libraries but cautioned about maintaining focus and avoiding scope drift. Recommended structured evaluation processes and thorough documentation for SNOMED and RAG integration. Highlighted the need for clear protocols for clinician feedback incorporation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendation\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the discussions, I recommend adopting a machine learning approach and utilizing existing open-source interpretability libraries. Specifically, we should build upon LIME, SHAP, Captum, and ELI5 for their robust capabilities and community support. This decision leverages tested tools, which can be customized to meet our unique needs. Additionally, integrating SNOMED and RAG will facilitate logical consistency and reduce hallucinations.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Justification**: Machine learning provides the flexibility and adaptability required for interpreting complex biomedical data. Existing libraries offer a solid foundation and can be adapted to our specific needs without the resource burden of building from scratch. Visual components using tools like Plotly or Tableau will enhance trust and usability for clinicians.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Answers\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Will you take a machine learning approach or not?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: Yes, we will take a machine learning approach.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: Machine learning can effectively handle the complexity and volume of biomedical data, allowing for dynamic interpretation and adaptability.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Will you use open source interpretability libraries from GitHub or create your own completely from scratch?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: Use open-source interpretability libraries.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: Existing libraries like LIME, SHAP, Captum, and ELI5 provide proven methodologies and community support, making them a practical choice for adaptation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **If modifying existing libraries, which interpretability libraries to build upon?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: LIME, SHAP, Captum, ELI5.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: These libraries are well-regarded for their interpretability features and have been successfully used in various applications, including clinical contexts.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **If designing algorithms from scratch, how exactly will you propose new algorithms?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: Not applicable, as we are using existing libraries.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: The decision to use existing libraries negates the immediate need for developing new algorithms from scratch.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **How will the interpretability tool use methods for eliminating LLM hallucinations, increasing faithfulness and reasoning, and promoting valid chain of thought logic using the SNOMED Database?**\n",
       "\n",
       "   - **Answer**: Integrate SNOMED and RAG into the tool.\n",
       "   - **Justification**: SNOMED provides a structured framework for medical terminologies, ensuring logical consistency, while RAG helps ground model outputs in real-world data, reducing hallucinations.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Next Steps\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Form a Sub-Team**: Establish a sub-team to evaluate the selected libraries against our criteria and conduct pilot tests.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Develop Data Protocols**: Implement automated tools like Great Expectations and Talend Data Quality for data validation and quality monitoring.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Clinician Engagement**: Initiate co-design workshops with clinicians using platforms like Miro and Figma to gather feedback and refine visualizations.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Integration Strategy**: Develop a detailed plan for integrating SNOMED and RAG, including visualization strategies and documentation of decision-making processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Regular Review Meetings**: Schedule regular review meetings to ensure alignment across teams and incorporation of ongoing feedback from all stakeholders.\n",

       "\n",
       "The goal of our meeting is to outline a software design approach for developing a tool that improves the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) in the context of electronic phenotype definitions. This tool should incorporate a visual component to build trust between clinicians and the model. We need to decide whether to use a machine learning approach, whether to leverage existing interpretability libraries or build our own, and how to integrate methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to eliminate LLM hallucinations and enhance reasoning with SNOMED Database support.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Team Member Input\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Computational Linguist**: Advocated for a machine learning approach, emphasizing the integration of SNOMED into models through enriched embeddings to guide reasoning and reasoning chains constrained by ontology rules. Stressed the importance of aligning model processes with clinical ontologies.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Clinical Informatics Specialist**: Supported a hybrid model incorporating machine learning with rule-based systems to validate outputs against clinical guidelines. Recommended pilot testing in clinical settings with feedback loops to refine the tool.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Data Visualization Expert**: Suggested using visual techniques like confidence intervals and color-coded tags to communicate effectively with clinicians. Proposed testing these techniques via user-centered design workshops and pilot tests, focusing on clarity and integration into clinical workflows.\n",
