    "## Project Specification Debugging\n",
    "The issue was that only one out of five team meetings was being saved as `.json` and `.md` files during the project specification phase. This was caused by attempting to run all meetings in parallel using `ThreadPoolExecutor`, which led to errors such as \"cannot schedule new futures after shutdown\" and failed runs due to rate limits or resource contention. The fix was to switch from parallel to sequential execution by replacing the thread pool with a simple `for` loop, calling `run_meeting()` one meeting at a time. This ensured each meeting had dedicated resources and time to complete successfully, resulting in all outputs being properly saved.\n"
